the ancient harda, to have been inspired by the Alban Maec. But if the same rulo
is ιο ιο applied ιο the Romana as to the Greeks, whose oldest poeta no doubt ars

wrestling, are better than the Greeks'!

(v. hh) But ii time acts on poetry as it does on wine, what number of years are required

new? lle is old and good. Well, tale away a montb ora year from the hundred.
Still he may be connted old. Thea l accept thia admission, and take away one by
one, lile the hairs from the horse’s teil, till ιι last he shall fall to the groand who
estimatae merit by a scale ol years, and only admires what death has consecrated.

(v. 50.) Ennius is a aege, and hold, and another Homer, in the eyes of our critice. ¹lle
cares nothing now sor lais dreams and his metempsychosis. Is not Naevius in our
hands and in our memorias? Such sanctity does age give ιο poetry. Men disputa
about the merita oi these old people. Pacuvius is called learned; Accius sublime;
Ali-anius’ toga would fit Menandcr; Plautus is rapid as Epicharmus3 Caecilius bents
all in severity ; Terence in dramatic skill. These we learn; these we crowd the
theatra ιο see. These are the only pects from Livias downwmds.

(v. 63.) Sometimes the vulgar judgmentis right, sometimes it is wrong. Ilit prefers
theac writers ιο all others it erra ς if it admits that there is a good deal that hanti-
qnated‚ mach thatis harah, nauch that is slovenly in thena, it iswise, and l agree
with it, and Jove approves. Ihave no wish ιο aee Livius and his poetry banished (l
remember too well Orbilius and his eane); but that any one should think thorn per·
fection is to me surprisiag. If asingle word atarto up here and there hetterthnn the
ται it carries οι the whole. On theotherhandl am indignant that any thing should
be found fault with, not because it is bad but ιοοοοοο it is new, and that not indal-
gonce but honour should be demanded lor the old. ll‘ l express a doubt about a play
ol Atta's, all the old men cry out against my impudence sor venturing ιο ιιι fault
with that which Aesopus and Roscius acted. But the real reason is that they con·
sider nothing can he right bnt what satislles them, or they οιιιοι beartothrow away
in their age what they got by heart aa boys. But he who prsises the songs os the
Salii, which he understands no better than l do, does so not from love ιο tham but
out ol envy ιο us. If Greeoe had always hated novelty as we do, what should we
have had thetis old? When she began ιο turn from war, and ιο degenerata with her
new iomanes, she went from athletes to horres, from sculpture ιο pointing, from
music ιο tragedy‚ like a spoilt child. But itwas ιο he expected when peace and pros·
perity came ς every thing that delights ia apt to pall.

(a. 103.) Once at Rome weused ιο see men rising early to erpoand the law ιο chunis, or
learning how ιο male money and ιο ιο thrifty. Now it ia all changed. and every
body is for writing poetry. 1 mysell, when l declara 1 ahall write no more, lie like a
Parthian, and hegin scrihbling before sun-riae. No man undertakes ιο steen s ship
who knows not how3 none administer medicinas bnt physicians, or handle tools bnt
worlmen; and yet, learned or unlearned‚ we all write poetry. This little errorhow·
ever has its advantagea. The poet loves not money, seara not loss of property, chests
not his ροιιοοι or hia ward, lives plainly ; and though he is os no nse in war, he is ol
use ethome, if yon allow that small things may help the great. Tha poet forma the
lips and chastens the minda of the young ς he recorda great deeds, surniahes grem
