friends, he may have been, Orelli suggests, son or grandson oi Δ. Gabinius, the iactibus
contemporary oi Cicero. The Scholiasta giro us no belp; and tho above inscription
stands alone. Acron had no knowledge oi it, for hc says, “Incertum eat quem allo-
quatur hacode.’' There may be something, however, in is; but the discovery oi the
name. were we certain oi it, would he of no valae beyond leading to the interanea that

Nonnuu subacta ferre jugum valet
Cervice, nondum munia comparis
Aequore neo tauri ruentis
In venerem tolerare pondus.
Circa virentes est animus tuae t
Campos juvencae, nunc fluviis gravem
Solantia aestum, nune in udo
Ludere oum vitulis salicto
Praegestientis. Tolle cupidinem
Immitis uvae: jam tibi lividos
Distinguet Anctumnus racemos
Purpureo varius colore.
