GARMEN XIV.

11 Postumus be iu this instance a rael name, Horace’s friend may have been 111 per-
101 10 whom Propertius wrotea beautiful elegy (11112) on the occasion of his going, as
Kuiuoel snppoees, with the mrfortuuate expedition 01 Aelius Gallus against the Arabians,
though there is no resemblance between the ode and the elegy, unless it may be traoed
in llorsce's ‘placens uxor' (v. 21). Propertius reproaches Postumus for leaving his
sd'oetionsta wife Galla, whose fldelity be compares with that 01 Penelope. Estre sap·
peaes it likely 1111 this Postumus is 11 who 111-11111 consul suffectus, and am. 10
triumphes for his victorias over the Dalrnatisns. This was Postumus Vibius. But it is
sl] vary uncertain. 111 odeis clearly one 01 11011 10 which any other name might bave
besu prefixed, since it only deols with Horaoe's ordinary commonplace, the certainty· of
11111 101111 men. 1111011 is rather more melancholy tlran usual. Jani cbooses 10
suppose 1111 Postumus was rich, but covetous and aelf-indulgent, afraid of death, 111
too 1111111 01 bis 111111. Daeier supposes Postumus to be no other than J nlius Florus,
towhom the third epistle 01 110 first bools and second of the second book are sd·
11111111. Tha Julian family, he says, frequently bore this suruame, and the qualities
wln'eb 1101111 assigna to the one he assigna also to the other, those qualities being am·
bition, fsar of death, aud a host 01 others. (See lipp. i. 3. 25, 111 11. 2. 201 sqq.) But
ss nm does not in reelity charge thess vices upon 11111101 111 1111111, as will be
mdily 1111 by aa attentive reader, they cannot be identified by this comparisou. 111
lars 01 this oda 11 as 1101111111 as the person, though J aui, from its sombre tone, sup·
με it meast 1111 1111 written lste.
