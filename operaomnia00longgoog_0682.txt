EPISTOLARUM 11. 1. 667

Ingeniis uon ille favet plauditque sepultis,

Nostra sed impugnet, nos nostraque lividus odit.

Quod si tarn Graecis novitas invisa fuisset oo
Quam nobis, quid nunc esset vetus? aut quid haberet

Quod legeret tereretque viritim publicus usus?

Ut primum positis aligeri Graecia hellis

Coepit et in vitium fortuna labier aequa,

Nunc athletarum studiis, nunc arsit equorum, ⁴

Marmoris aut eboris fabros aut aeris amavit,

Suspendit picta vultum mentemque tabella,

Nunc tibicinibuS, nunc est gavisa tragoedis 3

Sub nutrice puella velut si luderet infans,

Quod cupide petiit mature plene reliquit. 100
Quid placet aut odio est quod uon mutabile credas?

Hoc paces habuere bonae ventique secundi.

Romae dulce diu fuit et sollemne reclusa
