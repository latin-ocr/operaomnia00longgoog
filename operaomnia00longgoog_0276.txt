CARMINUM IV. 9. 213

Impune, Lolli, carpere lividas
Obliviones. Est animus tibi
1111111111 prudens et secundis 35
Temporibus dubiisque rectus,
Vindex avarae fraudis, ct abstinens
Ducentis ad se cuneta pecuniae,
Consulque non unius 11111

Sed quoties bonus atque lidus to
J udex honestum praetulit utili,
Rejecit alto dona nocentium
Vultu, per obstantes catervas
Explicuit sue victor arma.
