CARMINUM II. 6. 97

Thedabeof this ode has been much discussed. Patre places it very soon after Horaae's
first arrival at Rome, when he was fresh from the futigues of war, which the expression
‘Sit modus lasso maris et viarum Militiaeque' seems tofavour. Buta young inan just
returniug home to begin life does not begin by writing about aretreat for his declining
⁸reare. There is a character ubout the ode which belongs to a later period. He must
havebeen familiar with ‘liburand Tarentum and other localities which he alludes to. The
allusion to the Cantabri in r. 2 issupposed by others to fix the date much later, namely,
in amo. 729, when Augustus was engaged iu reducing a rebelliou iu Spain. At any time
before amc. 725, when the Cantabri were first reduced, they could have been called by
Horace ‘indoctos juga ferre nostra,’ even though uo attempt had been made to imposc
that yoke. Iu 725 they were reduced to subjection; in 728 they broke out again, and in
the following year they were finally subdued, though au unimportant disturbance hadbo
be put down hy Agrippa some years afterwards (see C. iii. 8. 21; iv. 14. 41. Epp. i. 12.
26). lf therefore the ode was written after 7 25, it must have been in the beginning of
729 or thereabouta, and 1 am inclined to think that was the data, though l admit the
difficulty ο7 understauding why Horace should speak of himself even poeticsdly us tired
of warfare aud the sea, so many years atter he had ceased to hove any thing todo with
either. That hc does uot speak of his Sabine farm, but ςὶοοο the preference to Tibur
or Tarentum, provee nothing. Loug aster he had possession of his farm, he expresses
his preference for those places (lipp. i. 7. 44) :-

— “ mibi jam uon regia Roma,
Sed vacuum Tibur placet aut imbelle Tarentum.”

(See also C. itit. 21 sqq.) Tbat he frequented Tibur is well known. Some say he
owned, some be rented, a small property there. It may, however, be doubted after all,
perhaps, whether Horace must be taken as speaking strictly of himself. He may only
mean, in effect, that the weary need scck uo happier reding-place than Tibur or Taren·
tum, though be puts the matter iu the form of a wisb for himself. It was probably on
or after arisit to Septimius that Horace composed the twenty-eightb ode of the first
book; aad, probably with the attractione of Tarentum fresh in his mind, ho wrote this
ode. But be may have paid bis friend many visits.

ARGUMENT.

Septimius, who urt ready to go with me to the ends of the earth, 1 would that 1 might
end my days at Tibur, or, ifthat be forbidden me, ut Tarentum. Abovo all others 1
love that tpot, with its honey, its olives, its long spring, und mild winter, and grapes
on Mount Aulon. On that spot we ought to live together, aud there thou shouldst
lay my bones and weep over them.
