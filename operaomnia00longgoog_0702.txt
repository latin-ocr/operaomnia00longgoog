sistency throughout.

(v. 153.) If yon went yonr pley to sncceed yon mnst stody the cheraeters ef

different ageas your child must be thoughtless eud playlu13 your youth fond of
meuly aperte, open tc temptation, intolcrent of odrice, improvident, espiriug, eud
fickle3 ycnr full-grown men must be ceutious, looking for money and friends ond
advnnoement3 while your old mun is snrrcnnded with troubles, evericious, rrorvous,
sold, procrastineting, slow cf hope, slnggish, grsedy cf life, morose, querulous,
commending the former dsys, a reprover of youth. ror feer theu of mixing up the
different periodo cf life, we should fix attention open the characteristics cf ench.

(v. 179.) The events must either pass upon the stage, cr be told aster they are over.
What is seen makes more impressicn thau what is hesrd ς but still lrorrors end inere·
dible marsele ere not ιο be treusectcd on the stege. A play should be iu five ects.
Nc god should be brought iu without necessity. No fourth person shouldbe allowed
to speek. 'l'he chorus should second the speakers, and should not sing what is irrele-
ποι. It should favour end connsel the good, calm the pensionete, commend
temporanee, justice, cbedience te the lnws, end peaoe; keep secrete aud oller prayers
tc the gods for mercy to the efflicted sud reugenuee on the tyraut.

(r. 202.) Once the fote was e plein instrument mede for the use of the chorus, aud not
ιο till great thaetrss, aa now. But this simple music changed when conquest end
luxury mixed up country end town. 'l'hen the dcte-plnyer strutted cn the stege,
and the lyre wes tuued to solemn sounds, tc pessinunte eloquence, or oreculer struim.

(r. 220.) Socn efter 'fragedy cerne the Satyric Drama, when fun sud grsrity were
repented, aud the spectatore iu the licence cf the honr were treated with fresh jokes
and novelties. But in these plays too there must be nc inconsisteneies, anch as ngod
or hero coming down tc turem-slung or lesing himself in fustian. 'lhegedy should
move lilre emodeat sud stetely metron emong the Satyrs. For 1 would not bonish
trsgic langunge altogether, so tlmt Silenus the god should tnllr in the seme strein
υ Darrrs the sleve. 1 would edopt a familiar style, so thet euy one should think he
could de it ss well till he ceme to try. Fenus must neither talk like city beeux nor
nse low language, lest they ctl‘end the better sort, though the vulgar may applend.

(s. 251.) Ashort syllable followed by n long melre nn iambus, the ropidity of which
mede the mnemon pnsslor a trimeter. At first cll the feet were iambi, till ιο gire
more mediness tc the verse spondees were admitted in the nneven feet. Accius end
Ennius nesrly bunishcd the iambus altogether. This is a blot in them, bnt it is not
every one that cen tell good versification from bed. Shsll 1 presume upon this? cr
ahsll 1 write centiensly, es if every fault would be detectedi’ Thus might 1 escape
bieme, bnt should win no preire.

(v. 268.) Take the Greeks for your medela end stndy them.

way, your fathers need ιο sdmire both the rlrythm and the wit cf Plautus.

Yes, stupidly enough, if we kuow the differcnea between coersoness and wit, and ceu
sun ο verse.

(v. 276.) Thespis is said ιο hese invented 'liugedy trevelling ebcut with his waggen,
end his ector-s smeered with wine lccs. 'l'hen eems Aeschylus with mssk, robe,
cothurnus, sud stege, eud taught them ιο speak grendly. After these the old
comedy, which was highly approved, till lieenee was sbused, end the law atepped in
and silenced the chorus. Our poete here been bold enough sometimes ιο quit the
Greek end celebrate home teles in tregedy rmd comedy, end n they were more diligent,
Iastium would be ea mighty in literature ns in erma. Oh! my friends, heve nothing
to ιι] ιο e poem which does not show marks of esre end correction.

(r. Μ.) Βοωοοο genius is above nrt, end eli poeta, according tc Democritus, are med.
my let their neila end benrd grew, effecting maduess. Fool that I sm to get rid
