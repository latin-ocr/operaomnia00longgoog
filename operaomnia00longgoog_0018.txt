Bitter's Commentary, and I havegot good matter from it. Ritter
sa sharp critic and 3 learned man, who has done something for
the explanation of Horace, and Ι acknowledge my obligations to
him. It is his business to excuse himself, if he can, for writing
some absurd notes and proposing some interpretatione which no
sensible man will accept

Ι have also used for the Satires and Epistles Krhger’s school
edition, with German notes. It is a very usefrsl book. Γ11330133
prove that the editor has good judgment, and what we in this
country call sound common sense, in which many learned editors
are very deficient.

Ι have not touched Mr. Maeleanc's arguments and introductione,
except in very few cases; nor have Ι added any thing on the chro-
nology cf the poems, except 3 little here and there. Mr. Maeleane
has done this very well. He judiciously abstained from fixing
dates where there is no evidence, unlike many critice who have
sometimes lixed them without evidence and sometimes contrary to
evidence. Indeed, most commentatore have very imperfect concep-
tions of the nature of proof3 and it would be a great improvement
11 they could be taught in some way not to confound hypotheses
and guesses with probable conclusions and demonstration.

Ι shall here put a question which some pcople may think unne-
cessary; but Ι (10 not think so. When a man has been used tc
read a book at intervals for half a century, 13 may reasonably ask
himself whether he has been wasting 113 time, and whether other
persons may not do the same. There 333 only few books worth
reading often or much ; but Horace is one of them. He lived with
some of the chief men of an age when the Roman polity was chang-
ing into a form which 133 had 3 lasting influencc on Europe, and
through Europe on the rest of the world; and his writings havc
made us familiar with theman himself, with the times in which 13
lived, the character cf his contemporaries, and the manners 01 113
day. Horace’s good sense makes his Satires and Epistles almost as
intelligible and 33 instructive 33 11 they were written now3 for the
best part of them 13 independent of the allusione to things and pcr-
sons, and many of the allusions are not more obscure than similar
