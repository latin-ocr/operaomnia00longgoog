coast of Italy. When thie happened nobody hnowe. After the publica·
tion of the three books of Odce, Horace seems ιο have ceaecd from that
style of writing‚ or nearly eo; and the only other compositione we know
of his having produced in the next few years are metrical Epietlee to
different friends, of which he publiehed a volume probably in huc. 734
or 735. He seems ιο have taken up the study of the Greek philoso-
phical writers, and ιο have got a good deal interested in them, and also
ιο have become a little tired of the world and diegusted with the
jealoueies hie reputation created. Hie hcslth did not improve as he got
older, and he put himself under the carc of Antonine Musa, the em·
peror'e new phyeician⁸. By hie advice he gave up, for a time at least,
his favourite Baiae. But he found it necessary ιο be a good deal away
from Rome, especially in the autumn and winter⁴.

In A.u.c. 737 Augustus celebrated the Ludi Saeculares, and Horace
was required ιο write an Ode for the occasion, which he did, and ithae
been preserved. This circumstance, and the credit it brought him, may
have given his mind another leaning to Ode-writing, and have helped
him ιο produce the fourth book, a few pieces in which may have bcen
written at any time. Ῑι ie said that Augustus particularly deeircd
Horace to publieh another book ol Odce, in order that those he wrote
upon the victoriae of Drusus and Tiberius (4 and 14) might appear· in
it The latter of these Odce was not written, 1 believe, till aee. 741,
when Augustus returned from Gaul. If so, the book was probably
published ⁴in that year, when Horace was fifty-twa. The Odce os the
fourth book ehow no diminution of power, but the reverse. There are
none in the first three books that surpaee or perhaps equal the Ode
in honour of Drusus, and few superior ιο that which ie addresecd ιο
Lollius. The success of the first three books, and the honour of being
chosen ιο composa the Ode at the Ludi Saeculares, ecem to have given

’ him encouragement. There are no incidente in hie life during the above
period recorded or alluded to in hie poeme. He lived five years aster
the publicationes the fourth book of Odes, if the above date be correct,
and during that timeI think it probable ho wrote the Epistles ιο Au·
gnstue and Florus which form the second boolr3 and having conceivcd
the intention of writing a poem on the art aud progrese of poetry, he
wrote as much of it as appears in the Epistlo ιο the Pisones which hae
been preserved among hie werke. The fragments of which that poem
appears ιο bc composed, and which some have rainly tried ιο reduce ιο
a consistent whole, may have been written earlier than I have suppoecd3

bnt there is eo much affinity between the Ars Poetica and the Epietlc
to Augustus that 1 believe they wore written at no great interval cf
