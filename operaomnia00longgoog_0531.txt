His words are: ‘⁸ Postquam senator oensu legi coeptus, judex fleri ceueu, magistratum
ducemque nihil magis exornare quam census, postquam coepere orbitas in auctoritate
summa et potentia esse, captatio in quaestu fertilissimo ee sola gaudia in poesidendo,
penum iere vitae pretia, omnesque amaximo hono liberales dictae artes iu contrarium
eecidme, ac servitute sola profici coeptum. Hane alins alio modo et in aliis adorare,
eodem tamen habendique ad spes omnium tendente voto.” Petronius (Sat. 124)
speaks of duding “turbam heredipetarum” at Crotona. He wrote in the reign of
liberius.

Duentaar calls this Satire ‘⁶ felicissima dctio.’' Dacier thinks nothing could be more
ingenious “que le tour qu'il donneh cette Satine, ni plus bem-eux que le choix des
auteurs qu’il introduit'' The extravagante of the anachronism and the incongruity
of the peneus heighten the absurdity, bnt do not help the Satira, as far as l cau see.
Homer (Odysa ai.) makes Ulyesce go down to Hadee and mere meet 'tiresias the
Theben prophet, who tells him of the hardships that awaited him in his journey home,
where however in the end he is destined to arrive. Horace supposes e continuationes
the inemec, aud makes Ulyssee ask the seothsayer how heis to repuir his fortunas
when he gets home, and dnds his property wanted by his wife’e enitere, as the prophet
told him it would be (see note on v. 6). Tiresiae, though he impliee that the cunning
ulysse· would be at no less in such a matter if he once got home, gives him his advice,
which isto lay himself ont sor pleusing old men and women of fortune, and getting
amad in their wills, for which he lays down a few ordinary rules, of which a perse·
werhag aud eearse servility lethe chief, ench as Periplectomenes describes in the Miles
(iluimus, iii. l. 110 sqq. Ulysses appears in as lowa character as he eam-an apt
disciple, ready to be the shadow of a slave, and to prostituta hie ehaate Penelope if need
be. 'l'hs ulysses of all poete after Homer ie a contemptible personage, and it must be
salu in favour of Horace that Penelope, whose character in tm Odyseey is feminine and
pure, is by later writers represented ns less cheete than Homer has drawn her. These
who osily know her as the dmnoue wife and mother, will not easily forgive the course
musicus to her in this Satine. &nadon and Dacier ere anxious it ehuuld be understood,
that when Ulyssea appears to acquiesce in the advice of the prophet, he has no intention
of demeaning himself so fur as to follow it: “il ee retine uprte la consultatione sana
stpendre wiredus, et sane cecam le parti d quoi il se dttermine” (Sanadou). As it
would be didicnlt to avoid condemning the whole construction of the Satine except by
mderstauding it tube an extravagant burlesque, we need not be ut the trouble of deter-
mining what the intentione of Ulysses were when th0 imperions Proserpina abruptly
mmuued his connsellor, and broke off the dialogne.
