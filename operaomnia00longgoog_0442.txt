011 the outside of the city walh, iu front of lifons Esquilinus lay the Campus Esqui-
uu, 111 which wasa public barini-ground for the poorest of the people, and the place
uecutiou for slaves aud others of tho lower sort, whose bodies were left uuburied for
edogs aud vultures to prcyupon (Epod.v.100). This place, which must always
re been a public uuisance aud a source ofmalaria, was given (aa some say) bya decree
tha senate to Maecenas, or else purchased by him, cleared, draIned, eud laid out in
rdeus, in which he afterwards built e haudsomc house (C. iii. 29. Epod. ix„ riv.
tmduaiou. S. ii. 3. 309). Η11 example was afterwards followed by a member of
ebouse of Lamia, iu whose gardens Caligula was buried (Suet. Calig. c. 59). The
loting Satira was suggested by a figura of Priapus set up in Maecenas' gardeu. The
dis represented aa contractiug the present state of the ground with what it once was,
*which a compliment is conreycd to hlacccuua for his public spirit in ridding tho
ις of such a unhnnce. Priapus also complains of the trouble he has in lreeping the
cnud clearof trespassers, bnt more particularly of the witches, who, haring formerly
tried ou their practices among the tomba aud boues of tha dead, continued to haunt
arcane of their iniquity. This ia introduced for the purpose of dragging iu the
1111111 whom Horace satirized under the nome of Canidia. The descriptionis iu some
a· very like that of the fifth Epode, aud the two may have been written about the
me time. It is not very likely Horace would have maintained his warfnre with this
man, whoerer she was or whatever her offeres, for several years. Kirchncr (Qu.
amp-16), because iu S. ii 3. 312 reference ia made 1ο Maecenas as engaged in build-
g, places these two Satires iu consecutive years, this being written 1110. 721 (Intro-
eum 1ο lipod. 1.). But there is not much in this argument. The clcnriug, draiu·
g. and enclosing of the 31011111 must hunc taken some time, and it may have
eu merul years before it was fit for living ou, and uo reference is mede to a house in
ie Satira. Franks places it 111 aue. 718. There isvcry little clue to the dato.
