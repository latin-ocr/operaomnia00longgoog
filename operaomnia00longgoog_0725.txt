Sic honor et nomen divinis ustibus atquc
Carminibus venit. Post hos insignis Homerus
Tyrtaeusque mares animos in Martia belle
Versibus execuit3 dictae per cuimine sortes;
Et vitae monstrate vie est 3 et gratis regum
Pieriis tentata modis ,· ludusque repertus
Et longorum operum finis: ne forte pudori
Sit tibi Musa lyrae sollcrs et cantor Apollo.
Nature fieret landabile carmen an erte

ι Quaesitum est: ego nec studium sine divite vens
Nec rude quid possit video ingenium alterius sic 410
Altera poscit opem res et conjuret amice.
