CARMINUM 1. 37.

Contaminato cum grege turpium
Morbo virorum, quidlibet impotens
Sperare fortunaque dulci
Ebria. Sed minuit furorem
Vix una sospes navis ab ignibus,
Montemque lymphatam Mareotico
Redegit in veros timores
Caesar, ab Italia volantem
Remis adurgens, accipiter velut
Molles columbas aut leporem citus
’ Venator in campis nivalis
Haemoniae, daret ut eatenis
Fatale monstrum ε quoe generosius
Perire quaerens nec muliebriter

Expavit ensem nee latentes
Classe cita reparavit oras.
