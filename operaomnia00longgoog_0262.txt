CARMINUM 1v. 4.

Venti paventem, mox in ovilia
Demisit hostem vividus impetus,
Nunc in reluctantes dracones
Egit amor dapis atque pugnae:
Qualemve laetis caprea pascuis
Intenta fulvae matria ab ubere
Jam lacte depulsum leonem
Dente novo peritura vidit:
Videre Raetis bella sub Alpibus
Drusum gerentem Vindelici 3-quibus
Mos unde deductus per omne
Tempus Amazonia securi
Dextrae obarmet quaerere distuli,
Nee scire faa est omnia 3-aed diu
