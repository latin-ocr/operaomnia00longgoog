EPISTOLARUM Ι. 16. 623

ARGUMENT.

Το sare you the trouble of arking about my estate, my good Quintim-my crepe aud
my olives, my mehercle, meadows, and vinee,-I will describe it ιο you at full
length. 'lbere is a chain of mountaiue broken hy a shady rehey, of which one side
receirat the reys of the morning sun, the other of the evening. 'lhe climate you
would like ; and when l tell you I have carrucis and plume growing wild, end oake
to give acorna ιο my swine aud chade ιο their mester, you will think Tarentum hne
ᾱιοιιιι nearer to Itome. 'lhen 1 have a spring worthy to give a namo tothe stream,
for Hebrus is not more clear or oool, good for the head and good tbr the stomaeh.
'l'o these retreats, which l love, and which are in truth delightiul, you owe it that
your friend is alive in September.

Yon too are connted a happy man: sec that yon be eo ; trust not to the judgment
of others bnt to your own of yonrself, and rcmember that none bnt the sago
is happy. Τιιο people may think you souud, but if you are consciens of a sever
in your veina, do not attempt to hide it. If any oue talks of your ware in languago
that lits only Augustus, you shrink irem the lie ς but when they call you good and
wisc, do you not accept the compliment? Wcll, say you, 1 like to he praised, as
Isuppose you do yourseli. But do you not know that they who give can take
away their praisei (live it back, say they, and you must do so. What il they orell
me thiel, parricide, does that effect me i who but tho eiciens caro for· false praiee
or falso blame? who is tho really good mani 'l'he vulgar· will point bathemen
who keeps the lawe, who decides important matters as a judex, and hae weight as a
surety and a witnese3 bnt hie intimatas may know him better. ‘l'hcre are some who
(lo not siu for ferar of punishment ι but the good man is good because he loves good·
nese. Your good man who is eo looked ap ιο when he sacrificos has his silent
prayer to Janns, llpollo, Lauerna, thot they will promote and hide his knavery.

husied in making money. Scll him for a slave: he is lit l'or that; whereas the
enge can say to his tyrant, “ Take all l have, put me in bonde if you will; but when

the goel alell thiuge.''
