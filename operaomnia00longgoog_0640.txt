⁴ EPISTOLARUM Ι. 15.

Rure meo possum quidvis perferre patique,

Ad mare cum veni generosum et lene requiro,
Quod curas abigat, quod cum spe divite manet

In venas animumque meum, quod verba ministret,
Quod me Lucanae juvenem commendet amicae.)
'lhactus uter plures lepores, uter educet apros,
Utra magis pisces et echinos aequora celent,
Pinguis ut inde domum possim Phaeaxque reverti.
Scribere te nobis, tihi nos accredere par est.
Maenius, ut rebus maternis atque paternis
Fortiter absumptis urbanus eoepit haberi,

Scurra vagus non qui certum praesepe teneret,
Impransus non qui civem dinosceret hoste,
Quaelibet in quemvis opprobria fingere saevus,
Pernicies et tempestas barathrumque macelli, .
Quidquid quaesierat ventri donabat cvrare.

Hic ubi nequitiae fautoribus et timidis nil

Aut paulum abstulerat patinas coenabat omasi
Vilis et agninae, tribus ursis quod satis esset 3
Scilicet ut ventres lamna candente nepotum
