CARMINUM 111. 4. 14⁷

Terei resurgat murus aeneus
Auctore Phoebo, ter pereat meis
Excisus Argivis, ter uxor
Capta virum puerosque ploret.
Non hoc jocosae conveniet lyrae:
Quo, Musa, tendis? Desine pervicax 70
Referre sermones deorum et
Magna modis tenuare parvis.

About sue. 728.

Pnrsuing his purpose, Horace here commende the power of wisdom end learning io
whduing brute force aud violent passione. If auo. 728 be the year iu which llorao
met with his accident (C. ii. 13), this ode could not have been written before that year,
ἱ tartha eirmnrstauee is referred to in r. 27. The expedition intended for Britain, but
