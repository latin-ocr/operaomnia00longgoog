GARMuN IX. ·

'lhisis sn elegsnttrille (⁶¹ sn incomparsble dissime? Buttmann calls it), showing the
process of reconciliation between two lovers. in which the desire lor pesce appears in the
midst el* pretended indifference, und mutual jeslousy is msde the means of rue-union. The
subject eould hardly hsve been more deliostdy hundled. whether the trestment ol itis
migiml or net, it is impossible to say. Itis just euch s subject as one might expect to
find among the erotic poetry of the Greeks. One ol Buttmann’s remarks with reference
te this odeis well worth quoting: “ 'lhe encients hsd the skill to construet such poems,
ιο thst esch speech tells us by whom itis spoken3 but we let the editors treet ns all
our lires ss sehoolboys, and interline such dialogues ester the sashion of our plsys with
the mmes. 'l'o their sedulity we are indehted for the alternation of the lyriesl name
ly& with the name Horatius in this exquisite work of nrt; snd yet, even in sn English
porus, we should be offended at seeing celin hythe side of Phyllis.” Such offense
the officionsness oi editors bas slresdy obtruded upon the readers of that poet; and the
paries, which justly offends the good teste ol this discerning scholur, hsd probably its
origin among nenses very eerliest transcribere. Like other unsuthorized interprete-
tiou, it tskes swsy from the artistic oharaeter of Hersee’s poems, and substitutos for it
supposititiam reality ab vsriance with the passionlese tone of the werke. As werke ol

skill they sss very elegunt 2 as works of feeling they must always rank low.
