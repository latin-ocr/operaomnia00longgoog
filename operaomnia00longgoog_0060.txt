CARMINUM Ι. 6.

Conamur tenues grandia, dum pudor

Imbellisque lyrae Musa potens vetat 10

Laudes egregii Caesaris et tuas
Culpa deterere ingeni.

Quis Martem tunica tectum adamantina

Digne scripserit aut pulvere Troico

Nigrum Merionem aut ope Palladis 15
Tydiden superis parem?

Nos convivia, nos proelia virgiuum

Sectis in juvenes unguibus acrium

Cantemus vacui, sive quid urimur

. Non praeter solitum leves. 20
