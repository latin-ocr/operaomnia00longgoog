EPISTOLARUM II. ι. 681

when yon should write. What was the use of my doing so if now you are ιο reproach
me aa if 1 had broken my word?

(v. 26.) An officer of Lucullue’ one night while he was asloep had all his money and
eqnipments stolen. He besam furious in consequence with himself aa well astho

enemy, and while his blood was np etormed and took one of the king’s strongest
places full of treasnre, for which he was promoted and rewarded. About the samo
time the general wanted to get possession ofa certain fortress, and calling the officer
he says to him, ‘Go, my brave friend, go where thy valonr calls thee, nnd great shall
be thy reward! ‘lisy' replies the cunning man, ‘send some one who has lost his
purae? .
(v. 41.) Ιι was my lot to begin my education at Rome and to finieh it at Athens. From

thence l was hurried off to the disastrons wera, and when I got my discharge at
Philippi, with my wings cropped, ahorn of my inheritancc,l was driven hy my
poverty towriteverses. But now that 1 have enough,1 should be mad pastrecovery
if 1 did not count my ease better than acribbling. Time is sterling every thing from
me-mirth, love, wine, end sport, and now it is taking poetry too. Resides people's
astes differ so much. Yon like song, another likes iambica, a third course satire.
How can 1 please yon all? Then again how oan 1 write among all the distractione
ofthe town? Hercu man calls me to bohis snrety; there to quit my buriness and
listen to his hooks3 one man issiok on the Quirinal, another at the extremity of the
Aventine, and 1 must see them both, s pretty good distance you must allow. ⁴011!
hut the streete are so broad and clear yon can think aa yon go along! Why there
is every sort of obstruction, contractors with their mules aud portem, omnes swinging
stones and beams over your head, funerala, mad doge, iilthy swine 3 1 should like
yon to make verses in ancha scene as that. The poet loves retirement and the
woods ς the student who has been for years poring over his books is rather awkward
in the world ς how can I write verses while the waves and storms of the city are
running abunt mei'

(r. 87.) Besidea, these pocta do nothing bat praise one another. ‘A wonderful work!
surely all the Muses had a hand in itl’ How we hold up our heoda and strnt past
the library which is one day to have a copy of our works! We contest it like two
gladiatore, and 1 come off an Alcaeus in hia judgment, and he a Callimachus, noya
Mimnermus if he likes‚ in mine. I could hear a good deal when 1 was cauvassing for
applanae ς but now that 1 have retired Ι shut my ears ιο them all.

(v. 106.) 'lhongh the public may langh athad verses, their authors are well satisfled, and
if you do not praise them, they will praise themselves. But he who would write s
real poem, must aot his own censor, and cut ont what is bad, even if he keeps it still
looked np at home. He will not fail to reproduce obsoleto but expressive words aa
well as new; he will pour along likea rapid river, and enmeh theland with the copions
stream of his eloquence; pruning, smoothing, erasing, the result will seem aa easy as
sport, like the mimo who twists hie limhs in the danoe.

(v. 126.) l had rather, says one, be looked upon as a fool, and he satisfied with my own
performances, than he everso learned and tormented to boot. Heislikethegcutleman
at Argos, who used to fancy himself sitting in the theatra, and clapping the performera.
Ha was perfectly sane in other respecto, and when his friends recovered him from this
mania, he hitterly complained that they hod taken away his pleasant illusion.

(v. 140.) But, aster all, the best thing is to put away child'a play and poetry, and take
tophilosophy. Therefore 1 reason with myself thusr “If you hade fcvcr in your veins
you would speak ιο the physician. But if the more yon have, themora yon want, will
you keep that to yourself f If you found a particular remedy did yon no good, you
would avoid that remedy. Wcll, you have heard men say thetis a man had money ho
