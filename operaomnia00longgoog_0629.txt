EPISTOLARUM I. lt. 609

Macrinus Agrippae Siculis quos colligis, Ioci,
Si recte frueris, non est ut copia major
nb Jove donari possit tibi. Tolle querelas 3
Pauper enim non cst cui rerum suppetit usus.
Si ventri benc, si lateri est pedibusque tuis, nil
Divitiae poterunt regales addere majus,
Si forte in medio positorum abstemius herbis

Ι Vivis ct urtica, sic vives protinus ut te
Confestim liquidus Fortunae rivus inauret ;
Vel quia naturam mutare pecunia nescit,
Vel quia cuneta putas una virtute minora.
Miramur si Democriti pecus edit agellos
Cultaque dum peregre est animus sine corpore valery
Cum tu inter scabiem tantam et contagia lucri
