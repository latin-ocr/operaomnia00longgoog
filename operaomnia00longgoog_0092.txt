OARMEN XXIV.

nnc. 730.

Jerome, in hia edition of the Cbrouiclea of Euaebiua, placeo the death of Quintilius
Verba, the subject ot thia ode, in the thet year ol the leeth Olympiad, thet ia ano.
7³⁰(cunt0n. F.H.). 'l'hia therefore lires the date of the ode. Quintilius was born at
Creurona end was u neighbour and friend of Virgil, through whom it taprobable Horace
made his acquaintance. He ia referred to (according to tho Scholiast who is probably
right) in the Epiatle to the Piros, v. 438 sqq, aa a diaceming critic ς and the language
there used shows thathe wau dead when it waa written. The scholiastAeron says, that

Horace noea iu thia ode. Servius alao, ou Virg. Ec. v. 20 (where he aaya aomo

ARGUMENT.

what bouada aball be eet to our grief for oue ao deur? Teach ua a mournt'ul atrain,
Melpomene. Can it be that Quintilius, whose lihc hlodeety, J notice, Fidelity, and
Truth aball not behold again, ie gone to his everlaetiug rest? bluny ia the good mun
that mourna him, but noue more truly thau thou, Virgil. 'Twas not for this thou
didst commit him to the cure of Heaveu. But in vain thou dost askhim back. 'lhe ’
lyrc of Orpheae could not bring buck the blood to the shudowy form which Mercury
bath gulbered into hell. ’Tis hurd to bear: but patience malaca that lightcr which

uo power can change.
