‘Scribe ᾱοοοιιι a Nerio-⁹

‘lha reading in the'tsxt is ‘Scribe decem Nerio,’ and if thetis tho true reading, tha
explanation iu the notes may be as good as any other. But as the reading ‘scribe
decem a Nerio’ has the better authority, we must attempt to explain it. There is no
occasion ιο show hers that ‘decem’ means a sum os money. That is proved clearly iu
the unte ou S. ii. 3. 69, aud by Krdger in a useful acanus ou this passage. Tha exple·
nation of Orelli ond Ritter that ‘decem' means ‘decem tabulas' is a mutabo which
we could hardly expect such excellent commentatore to malsc.

We must next consider what ‘acribo a Nerio' meana. The proposition ‘ab ' is thus
used in apassage of Cicero (pro Flacco, c. 19, quoted by liniger), ‘Si praetor dedit, ut
est scriptum, a quaestore numeravit ι quaestor a mensa publica, mensa aut ex vectigali
out ex tributo ι’ which means, the praetor pald by au order on the quaestor3 thequae·
ator gave au order ou¹ the public bank, and llually the baulx paid the money out οι
tha funda which it had iu possession. The passage iu Livy (24. o. 18, ‘a quaestore
perscribebatur ') may also be compared with this in Horace.

The conclusion ia that ‘scribe decem a Nexio' expresses a puymeut of money made by
the baukcr Nerius ιο some borrower, and made purauant ιο the order ol some leuder,
who may be Perilliua (v. 74, ‘Perilli dictantis quod tu numquam rescribere possis’).
'Ibe entry in the boolxs of Nerius ol tha loun made on the order ol Perilliua would be
evidence against the horrower, sor the eutry would be made with his knowledge sud
consent. Aa ‘scribere’ bere expresses the leudingof the money, so ‘rescribere ' expresses
the repayment3 for the evidence of the repaymeut would be an eutry iu the books
which would have the effect ol' annulling the entry ol the debt.

1r it should be aslued ιο whom is the word ‘scribe' addressod. tethalenderor the
boxrower, the auswm is that it is not necessary to suppose the word to be addressed to
either. It means no more than ‘suppose Nerius ιο advance a sum os money to a bor·
rower upou the order οι a lenden! Further, ‘suppose a hundred written weuritiea
besides, such securities as wily Cicuta employs.’ All these words in the second pessum
‘scribe' ‘adde’ ‘rapies' ‘tu rescribere possis' mustbeinterpreted generally: ‘suppose
the money lent ;' ‘suppose the additional written securities ς’ ‘suppose the dehtor brought
into court ς’ aud lastly, in ‘tu nunquam rescribere possis,' ‘tu' is Damasippus or any
man who borrows and does not repay.

Δ lilxe use of ‘ adda’ occurs iu S. ii. 8. 321, ‘adde poemata nuno!

The passage, though it is difficolt and has given the commentatore much trouble,is
perlectly plain, is we loolx at it in the right way. Krirger’s is the only ιιιιο explanation
that 1 have seen. G. 1..
