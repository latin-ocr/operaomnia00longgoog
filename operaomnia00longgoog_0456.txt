SATIRARUM 1. 10. 425

sualua X.

'lhe line ot selidet'ence Horace took in the fourth Sutirs (see Introduction, ond
v. iim), led him into a criticisrn ot Lucilius, which gave a fresh handle to his adversa·
ries, who professed an admiration for that poet, hut admired him tor his worse furdts of
teste, and especially lor his combinationes Greek words with his mother tongra—u
practica the adsention of which no one would more instinctively feel and condemn thun
Horace. 'lhe occasion did not give scope for' much good writing and the Sutire lias
little merit as a composition. Somebody wishing to try his skill in imitating Horace,
prefixed to this poem the following verses, which sre generally, though not universally,
ellosred to be spurious, but they appear in some good MSS. llranke (F. H. p. 107) says
they arc genuine. 'l'hey are discussed in un Excursns by Orelli, und in a-puper by
Jacobs (Lect. Ven. xi.) :-

“ Lucili, quam sis mendosus, teste Catone
Defensore tuo, pervincum, qui malefactus
Emendare purat versus ; hoc lenius ille
Estque vir melior, longe subtilior illo,
Qui multum puer et loris et funibus udis
Exhortatus, ut essct opem qui ferre po'e'tis
Antiquis posset contra fastidia nostro,
Grammaticorum equitum doctissimus. Ut redeam illuc ;'’

ARGUMENT.

well, 1 said that Lucilins’ verses were rough. And who cun deny iti But 1 gova
him osuit at the same time for his great wit. If allowing this 1 must allow him
every thing, the sarcos of Laberiusl must call poems of great beauty. It is not
enough to raise elaugh, though thet lias its merit; there should be terseness and
variety, going from gravo to gay, from the severe orator or tho keen satirist to the
polished wit. Δ mixture of humour and severity is the way to settle grave questions.
This was the ground os the old comediuns, whom Hermogenes and his mincing tribe
never read a word of.

‘⁸ Oh! but Lucilius was grentio the blendingos Greek words with our own.'' Block·
herde! Is thot a grem thing which Pitholeon ean do? ‘¹ But a lenguags com·
pounded of the two is surely so much sweetcr, liko mixing Chion und Falernian
'insul’ Now Ι ask yon, would you apply thst rulc to the languuge of the Forum?
And while our great advocates are working out their speeehes with much labour in
ene best possible Latin, would you mix up yours with Greek l When 1 once thought
os writing Greek verses the shade os Romulus appeared to me by night, and bade me
rather carry faggotsto the forest. So while Alpinusis murdering heroes in bombast,
1 stiek to my unambitious trilles. Fundanius may write comedy, us he does better
then any man living ς Pollio muy write tragedy ς Varius bold epics3 Virgil bucolics;
my mongon lies in that style in which Varro and others have failed, though 1 am
not equa] tc Lucilius who invented it. 1 have no wish to rob him oi the crown that
is his due.

But 1 said the how ot' his verse was thet of s muddy stream, carrying with it more
nnuman beuntiss wal, do you never flnd ablotevsnin Homer, with all your learn-
ing? Did not Lucilius tlnd saulis in Accius and in Ennius? Why may not Ι in·
