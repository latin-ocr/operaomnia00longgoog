OARMEN IV.

Lucius Sestius sarred with Horace under Brutus, and they were no doubt on ter-ms of
intimacy (see Dict. Biog. Sestius 6). But this ode has probably us little ιο do with
L Sestius as with any of Horace's other friends. The poet horrowed his name to give
point to an ode written ιι the beginning of spring and moralizing on the uncertainty of
life snd the duty ol enjoying it. The same remark, with a change in the names, will
spply ιο C. iv. 7. Traces of imitation from the Greek aro observed by some commen·
uren, and some Sicilisn poem containing references ιο neumanensis fixed upon ss tho
source of this ode. Also it hes been conjectured, that it may have been written ut
Baiae οι· Velia in sight οι· the Liparaean volcanic islands, which may or incy not have
been the cnse. We de net want both explanatione 3 perhaps neither. Beyond the word
‘urit’ which seems ιο be a translation of φλέγει, 1 sm not nivere that there are as
msny emes os the Greek as might be found in most os Horace's odes.

The time must bc quite the commencemcnt oi the spring. nne whole description,
in which tbe present tense is used throughout, indicates the beginning of those things
um are described ; aud though Ovid, referring Ιιο the mouth of April (Post. ἰι. 131),
speaks es the launching of the ships,-

“ Vere mouet curras materna per aequora puppes
Ire, nec hibernas jam timuisse minas,''—
liorsoe’s words clearly refer to an earlier mouth. Rntgersius contende very strongly
thst Aprilis the month ιο which the descriptione of this ode belong, especially ιι. 11, 12,
which, hs says, refer ιο the Palilia, the festival ol Rorne’s birthday, which was the alst
Apn'l. But that is much ιοο lete. See note on ι. 11. Rutgersius contradicts himself
by nying that the allusion in ι. 9 refers ιο the practice of Roman metrone buthing with
metr nnn· mmcd with myrtle, which took place on tho calends of April. On. Fest.
