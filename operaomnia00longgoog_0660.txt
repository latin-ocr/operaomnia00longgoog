EPIS'POLARUM Ι. 18.

Quamvis nil extra numerum fecisse modumque
Caras, interdum nugaris rure paterno 5
Partitur lintres exercitus; Actia pugna

Adversarius est frater, lacus Hadria, donec
Altemtrum velox Victoria fronde coronet.
Consentire suis studiis qui crediderit te,
Fautor utroque tuum laudabit pollice ludum.
Protinus ut moneam, si quid monitoris eges tn,
Quid de quoque viro et eui dicas saepe videto.
Percontatorem fugito, nam garrulus idem est,
Nee retinent patulae commissa fideliter aures,
Et semel emissum volat irrevocabile verbum.
Nou ancilla tuum jecur ulceret ulla puerve
Intra marmoreum venerandi limen amici,

Ne dominus pueri pulchri caraeve puellae Α
Munere te parvo beet aut incommodus angat.
