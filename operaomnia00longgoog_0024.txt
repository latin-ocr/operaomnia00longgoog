a naval people3 and the Poeni were. The ‘llosporus' served
Horaoe on this oeeasion, andis useful again when he speaks of soar-
ing into the airin the form of a bird (C. ii. 20. 14) and visiting the
roaring Bosporus.

When wa have long been aoenstomed to a reading, it is very dif-
fienlt to aooept another, even if there is better evidence for it, and
good reasons. Thus in C. ii. 20. 13, Keller has ‘jam Daedaleo
notior Icaro? Ι hardly know whether ‘ocior' or ‘ notior' is sup-
ported by tha better evidence. Perhaps ‘notior’ is3 and if we
aeoept it, we eseape tha ‘Daedaleo ocior! Still partly from habit,
and partly for other reasons, Ι am not yet reconoiled to ‘notior'

In C. iii. 4. 9, ‘altricis extra limen Apuliae‚’ the question of
‘ Apuliae’ is hotly debated. The word ‘Apuliae’ following ‘Apulo'
is not the kind of repetition which seems to me to be an argument
against ‘ Apuliae ς’ nor is the argument derived from the quan-
tity of the first two syllables in ‘Apuliae’ conclusive. Itis a
case in whioh eritios may differ; but ‘Apuliae' is now generally
condemned. There is a note on this passage.

The boldest attempt at alteration that I know is in (l. iii. 24. 4:
‘Tyrrhenum omne tuis et mare Apulioum,’ where Keller has ‘ ter-
renum omne tuis et mare publicum,’ and Ritter has ‘Tyrrhenum
omne tuis et mare Ponticum! Bentley has said nothing against
the common reading. ‘Terrenum' isLaohmann's. It is quite plain
that Horaoe, aoeording to his fashion, would use a proper name here,
and the MSS. have ‘Tyrrhenum’ or some equivalent form. Ithink
it ia equally plain that the verse would end with some other proper
name, and ‘Ponticum' is supplied by some manuscripts. Others
have ‘pulicum’ ‘ publicum‚' ‘apulioum,' ‘ punicum? Here is a
suase of real difficulty, but it isa most perverse soleation to ehoose
‘publicum' when we plainly require the name of a sea contrasted
with the ‘Tyrrhenum' If the difficulty about ‘ Apulioum’ is in-
superable, we must take ‘Ponticum’ whieh being a proper namo
answers ono domandos the text, but does not satisfy in other
respecta, for we want the name of a sea corresponding to ‘Tyrrhe-
num’ instead of being carried off to the Euxine.
