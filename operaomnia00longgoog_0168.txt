GARMEN XX.

'lhis ode has noue of the appearance to my mind of having been written, lile tbe lust
tl the third boon, for the purpose of clcsing and commendinga completcd work, aa those
snm who believe the first two boola were publiabed separately. 'lbere does not appear
the any method iu the arrangement os the odes between the introductory one of the
huten and the last of tha third (with tbe exception of the hrst six of that book
ulti are evidently connected with one another) ; and the position of thia is probably
svaueual as unt os othere. Thia ode appears to have bccn written impromptu, aud
lihnl the style is mccl-heroic, or but half serious, though Horace had at least aa much
'hiim others to commend his poetry and to be conscious oi his own powers. Various
mmor selfcommcndation, ou¹ the part of the poete, are quoted hy Dillenbr.,
heiming with Ennins’ lamone verses,-

“ Nemo me lacrumis decoret nee funera fletu
Ferit. Curi Volito vivu’ pcr ora virdm.’'
1 illul ‘quem voeaa’ refers to some particular invitation of hlaeoeuas, and that the odo

lutet commeuts on this ode in hia Qu. Hor. (1841, Bonu). He there treats it as an
cutura ofpcuthful spirits on tbe occasion oi lllaeceuas' first invitation (Sat. i. 6). The
ePllhet 'dilecta' implping long familiarity, is oppoecd to this view, sud Dillenbr. says
mhhg about it in his edition of Horace, though he there treats the ode as a juvenile
