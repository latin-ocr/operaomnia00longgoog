INTRODUCTION. xxvii

Canidia some real intrigueand jealouey nodoubtare connected, whatever
her name may bave been.

The same remark applies in some measure ιο other Odes addressen
nominally ιο friends, but which might as easily be addressed to one
friend ae ιο another. The difference is that the names are in most
instances known to be those of real persons, which bas led many com·
mentators into inferenees respecting the characters and circumstances
of those persons which I believe ιο be in most instaures imaginary.

lhare expressed my opinion of Horace as a Satirieal writer in various
places. On this point the reader may refer to the remarks in the
lntmduction to the ninth Satire ol the first book. 0f common sense
and a perceptiones the ridiculoue; of that knowledge ol mankind which
is gathered by mining with the world; of dmmatic skill; of good
natnre and good breeding, Horace bas shown sufficient proofs, both in
the Satires and the Epistles. As a critic he is certainly defective.
Homer he does not appear ιο have understood. Plautus and Terence
he could not appreciate, and the merite ol Lucilius (and he must have
had merite) would probably never have been acknowledged or discovered
by Horace but for the seeling his criticism of that writer raised against
himself. He was of an indoleat habit, os which the unfiuished state os
some of his poeme is one of the effecte. “Amphora coepit Iustitui3
currente rota cur urceus exit ?” is a question that might be applied, I
think, to more than one of his Satires and Epistles. There is more
inequality in these than in the Odes3 more also thetis common-place iu
thought and diction. The Odes will bear better than the Satires and
Epistles the close inspection that an editor is obliged ιο give them. Any
one who undertakes that office for Horace will find that one of his prin·
cipal difficulties consiste in the examination‚ first separately, aud then
collectively, of so many small pictures as the Odes present. The tendency
of commentatore ιο sar-fetched conjectures as to their scope, allusione,
date, dcc, is very great, and the above difficulty partly accounts for it.
Their beautiee and merite appear to me ιο be of a quiet kind, and
the happy selection of words is one of them. Homce's selection ol
epitheta is judicious and sorcible. “ Mirus ac paene divinus Horatius
est in epithetis inveniendis ⁶.” The tersenees and good sense estha
sayings which concern human lise and character are as striking as
the manner in which they are introduced, being always in their place
and never brought in clumsily, as such sentences with less art might
easily appear. Herein, more than in any other respect, Horace suc-
ceeded in his attempt ιο imitate the Greek Lyric poete. Their fire,
passion, sablimity, hie languege was incapable of expressing even ifhis
mind could have concoired them. Their matres herclest their strength
