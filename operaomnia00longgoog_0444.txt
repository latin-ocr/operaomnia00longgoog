SATIRARUM Ι. 8. 413

Hoc miserae plebi stabat commune sepulcrum, ro
Pantolabo scurrae Nomentanoque nepoti:

Mille pedes in fronte, trecentos cippus in agrum

Hic dabat, Heredes monumentum ne sequeretur.

Nunc licet Esquiliis habitare salubribus atque

Aggere in aprico spatiari, quo modo tristes

Albis informem spectabant ossibus agrum3

Cum mihi non tantum furesque seraeque suetae
