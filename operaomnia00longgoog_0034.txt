INTRODUCTION. xxix

ipsius habui ostendi '³ (on S. i. 6. 41). The sama Salioliast refere more
than once to books that had been written anthe persone mentioned by
Horace. A reference to Estre’s work spoken of in the Prefaoe will
show theta catalogue of those persone embraces nearly all the dietin-
guiehcd men of the day, with most of whom Horace was on friendly
tems.

The Matres adopted by Horace from the Greek· are thirteen in
number in the Odes, and eix in the Epodee. Ipurpoee saying only a
few words on each.

O. i. l.-The matre of this Ode isone of three, called after

Asclepissges, a lyric poet of uncertain date. It ooueists of single lines
divided uss

..-Ι-υυΙ-ΙΙ-υυΙ-υε

Tho caesura usually falle on the long syllable after the end of tho
second foot. There are two exceptione only in Horace, ii. 12. 25, and
ir. 8. 17. The Greeks did not follow thie rule, and their lines were
lese monotonous in consequence. The division of thie metra by

choriambi is against the obvious rhythm. C. iii. 30, iv. 8, belong to
the same.

C. i. 2.-Thie matre takes ite name from Sappho. It consiste of
stanzas of four verses each. The first three are elika, and coneiet of
four trocheee, with a dactyl in the third place. Horace always aab·
stitutee a spondae for the second trachea, with one uncertain exception,
C. S. 70. The fourth verse consiste of a dactyl and spondae, and ie
named an Adonic.

'I'hisis one of the commoneat metrce. It differs in Horace'e hande
from the Greek usage by the less frequent introduction of the trocheo
in the second place, and from the caesura usually falling after the
fifth syllable. This arrangement takes away a good deal from tha ‘
vigour of the metra, a defeet which Horace seems to have pereeived
when he wrote the Carmen Saeculare and the Sapphic Odes of the
fourth book ¹.

² 1 rubjoin some remarlre from the “Journal of Education,”1832 (vol. iv. ps 356),
on Dr. Carey's “ Latin Proeody made Easy.'' Tha author observes: ‘¹ It greatly coa·
duces to the hermony of the Sapphic verso to male the caesura at the fifth semifoot, aa
‘Dira quem proles Niobea magnae ς’ not aa ‘Haec Jovem sentire Deosque cunctoe,' ’'
-a very common opinion. Το which the reviewer replia= ‘¹ Toour ears the latter ie at
