EPISTOLARUM Ι. 13. ⁴ ola

Si validus, si laetus erit, si denique poscet ς
N e studio nostri pecces odiumque libellis
Sedulus importes opera vehemente minister.

Abjicito potius quem quo'perferre juberis
Clitellas ferus impingas, Asinaeque paternum
Cognomen vertas in risum et fabula fias.

Victor propositi simul ac perveneris illuc,

Sic positum servabis onus, ne forte sub ala
Fasciculum portes librorum ut rusticus agnum,
Ut vinosa glomus l'urtivae Pyrrhia lanae,
