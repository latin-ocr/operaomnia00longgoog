naen Bavaria snd Suebis, sud some part of the Tyrol. The Baeti lay to the south
oitbeVrndelici, aud reached tc Lake Come ou the south. These tribes, whom the
litonum describe as very derce and warlikc, commenced ι system of predatcry incur·
Dus intc Cisalpine Gaul, in which they appear tc have practiaed the greatest atro·
fidu (Dion Cass. liv. 22 ς Strabo, p. 206). Augustas was at this time (auc. tae-39)
illiansalpine Gaul, and 'liberius was with him· Drusus, his step-son, arid younger
hother of Tiberius, was Quaestor at Rome, and in his twenty-third year. He wes
'tedred by Augustus tc take the field against the offending tribes, whom he met nuder
belunentine Alps and defeated signslly. But though driven from Italy they eon·
iared their attacks upon Gaul, and 'liberius was accordingly seut by Augustus with
Me troops to his brothefs ussistmee, aud between them they effectually humbled the
hbes whose territoriee were constituted a Roman province, afterwards named the
laetaberis Prima or Proper, aud Secunda, which embraced the possessione of the Vin·
blei: these also comprised several other tribes, of whom Horace particularly mentions
iit dramni and Breuni. The whole of this war took place in the spring and summer
tue year auc. 739, aad we are lad te suppose frum O. iv. 14. 34-38, that it was
ibtght to a conclusion in the mouth of August, on the anniversary of the capture of
dknndria by Augustus in the year 724 (Ο. i. 37, Introduction). In honour of these
mosa Horace composed this ode and the fourteenth of this book, the one more ex·
lffflly tc celebrate the name of Drusus, the other of Tiberius. 'l'he two odes therefore
burt hister-'really bc riewcd together. Whether they were written while the wars were
mrsu, or on the return of Augustus to Rome in the year auc. 741, is doubted;
lut 1 incline to think they were written at different times, aud should rather, from the
&seur cf the odes themselves, infer that the first was written immediately on the
b'dings of Drusus’ victory before his brother joined him 3 and that the second, which
hensch less spirit in it, was commed on Augustns' return and by his desire, aa a
wppkment te the first. The popularity of Drusus and the hopes that were entertained
tf him would creste much enthusiasm at Roma on the occasiones his success in his
campaign, and there isa hearty aud vigorous tone about the fourth ode which does
aa appear so conspicuously in the fourteenth. Here the praises of Drusus are uppcr·
ut in tlse poet's mind, there Augustus is the real theme, and 'liberius can hardly bc
sid tc hear more than the second part. Nevertheless I agree with Franke in thinking
tinget-uls that Horace would have written the fourth ode without an allusion to
libutus if his victorias in conjunction with his brother had taken place, cr boen known
ssus shuts composed it. There is indeed tacit reference to Tiberim in v. aa,
