Sr bene be novi metues, liberrime Lolli,

Ut matrone meretrici dispar erit atque

Discolor, infido scurrae distabit amicus.

Esthuic diversum vitio vitium prope majus,
Asperim agrestis et inconcinna gravisque,

Quae se commendat tonsa cute, dentibus atris,
Dum vult libertus dici meru veruque virtus.
Virtus est medium vitiorum et utrinque reductum.
Alter in obsequium plus aequo pronus et imi

Sic iteret voces et verba cedentis tollit,
