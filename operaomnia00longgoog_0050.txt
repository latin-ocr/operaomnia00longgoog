CARMINUM Ι. 3.

CARMEN III.

The date 01 1111 oda hasbeen much discussed. 11 istha chronologists' stumbling·
1110011. 11 11 was written on the occasion 01 that voyage to Athens 110111 which Virgil
only returned to die, the date must bc Δ.11.ο.135. How that interseras with the
rechoning 01 Franks and others maybe 10011 by referringto the introductory remarks
10 11111 edition. Franke however denies that this ode has reference to that voyage.
He eren thinks it doubtful whether itis addressed to Virgil the poet ; and though he is
in general very acute and judicious, his scal 1011110 theory he advocates ran away with
his judgment when it led him 10 think 11111 Quintilius, whose death islamented in (124
01 this book, is the person here addressed, and that perhaps he was drowned on the
voyage, since it is clear, says he, from that ode that he met with an untimely and vio·
lent death. Coming from most other people this theory would not be worth mentioning.
'l'hat 11 istha 1010110111 advocate in difficulty is clear ou the face 01 it. He thinks these
two odes are closely connected, though tho link has beeu lost to us from the obscurity 01
the allusione, but he finds 1111000111 iu the words '‘Navis quse tibi creditum Debes ’'
(s. 6 01 this ode) ; and (121. 11, “Τι1 frustra pius heu! nou ita creditum.'' ’111010 is no
weight 111 this argument 111111 nevertheless, there 11 110 certainty that the ode was
written on the occasion supposed. Virgil may have made 01 contemplated a voyage
before his last, and there 11 so much difficulty attending the date amc. 735 that I am
inclined to think such must have been the 0110. This leaves the date 01 the ode iu
uncertaiuty. Franke's best argument is, that if the publication of these odes 10011 place
after Virgil's death, it must have been immediately 01 vcry soon aster, even according
10 the chronology 01 Kirchner and others who are opposed to him; and that it would
hare been in the worst tuate and feeling to have inserted this ode at such atime. There
can be little doubt, 1 think, but he would have suppressed it, or accompanied it with one
expressing his own and the universal sorrow. Ioannot imagine a greater moclrery than
the insertion 01 an ode addreased to Virgil on the death 011111 friend, and an ode praying
101 hia safe voyage, at atime when all Virgil's friends must have been bewailing his
death, 10 which no allusion is made iu any part 01 Horaee’s writings. This last fact
would bc acccuuted 101 ifwe supposed Virgil to have died during the time when Horace
had almost 11 not entirely suspended this kind of writiug. 11111101 attempt to show
that there was not that mutual affection between Virgil and Horace which would warrant
the expressions 111 this ode isvery weak. But others have affirmed the same because
Vugil nowhere mentions 1101100, and because he did 1101 leave him his literary executor,
but chose Varius and Tucca rather than Horace. But Virgil left his AEneid not to be
published but destroyed, 11111 there 11 no reason why he should have chosen Horace 101·
asch a purpose. A man may have more 1110111111110100111011,11111(10011101 always give
that 011100 10 those he loves best. As 101 the other argument, 11 the uuture 01 Virgil’s
poema be considered, it 111101 worth noticiug.
