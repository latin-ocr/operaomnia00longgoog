CARMINUM 111. 2. 141

Virtus repulsae nescia sordidae
intaminatis fulget honoribus,
Nee sumit aut ponit secures
Arbitrio popularis aurae.
Virtus recludens immeritis mori
Caelum negata tentat iter via,
Coetusque volgares et udam
Spernit humum fugiente penna
Est et fideli tuta silentio
Merces: vetabo qui Cereris sacrum
Vulgarit areanae sub isdem
Sit trabibus fragilemve meeum
