CARMINUM ΙΙΙ. 13. 175

The odeis en addreas to alountain, acommon subject enough, and we need only
ruppose that the name was suggested to Horace by tbe recollectione of his ehildhood,
without imagining him really on the point of offering sacrifice, or being in the neigh-
bourhood of his birth-place when he wrote. lt has something of tho nature of an epi-
gramma or inscription, andis among the choicest of Horace’s small piceas.

ARGUMENT.

Fair fonnhin of Bandusia, thou art worthy of my libation and of the liid that shall sall
sor thee ter-morrona and dyc thy eold stream with his blood. Thea the summer’sheat
pieroetb not3 ooolis thy water to the tloelrs end herds. Thou too shalt be placed
among the sountains os saure when 1 sing of the oak thathangs from the rook whence
thy babbling wetere spring.

Ο nous Bandusiae, splendidior vitro,
Dulci digne mero non sine floribus
Cras donaberis haedo
Cui frons turgida cornibus
Primis et venerem et proelia destinat 3 5
Frustra: nam gelidos inficiet tibi
Rubro sanguine rivos
Lasoivi suboles gregis.
Te flagrantis atrox hora Caniculae
Nescit tangere, tu frigus amabile ιο
Fessis vomere tauris
Praebes et pecori vago.
Fies nobilium tu quoque fontium,
Me dicente cavis impositam ilicem '
Saxis, unde loquaces
Lymphae desiliunt tuae.
