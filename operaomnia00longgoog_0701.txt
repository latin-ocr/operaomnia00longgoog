Tum ls no sufficient iuternel evidence of the time when this poem was written or
of the persons ιο whom it is addresscd. They are three in number, a fethcr aud two
sons. Porphyrion und Comm. Cruq· say that the father is L. Calpurnius Piso caeo
ninus, who was Pmcfectue Urbi under 'liberius (Tac. Ann. vi.10). 1r this be so, as be
wer born in suo. 705, end hod ut this time e son verging ot least on manhood (for
to uo other would this sort of instruction ho uchlrcsscd3 sce w. 366), the poem must
heve been written vcry shortly before the dcet-h of Horace, emo. 746. Orelli eud
liirchner, and many othcrs, tslre this view of tho dete. Esne, freolse, aud many
before them, put it earlier, end in that cene ediffcrent Piso must be assumed. Tho
person supposed by the advocates of an earlier dcte is Cu. Calpurnius Fuso. who
belonged to the party of Brutus end Cassius, end fought together with Horace ut
Philippi. He had e son who was consul emo. 747, and if ho wus the youth referred
tc, the Ars Poeties must have been written e good muuy years before. But the question '
isone it ie impossible ιο decido, and nothing turns upon it for the understandiug of the
poem, which, like many others, might be addresscd to any bodyc though 1 do not egres
with those who suppose Horace hed no particular pensem in mind. The Pisones abore
referred ιο ure numbered 8, 22, 23, in the Dict. Biog.

As to the purpose of the poem 1 have tried ιο help the reader iu judging for himself
by e carefnl divisiones the Argument. lt will be seen that tho rules are miscellaneons
sud hare little or no methed, and that the history of Poetry which Horace gives is
more fenciful than real. It is impossible ιο loolr upon it as e tinished poem. We aro
carried from precept to history, and from ono sort of poetry ιο another without
warning ; and though a genersl connexion mny be traced between the principles of one
lrind and those of another, no pains are tehen to seperate the rules that hclongto eech.
'I'he rules and history of the Drama ure chiefly dwclt upon, with what particular
bearing upon Itonion poetry it is not easy to sce. Much thot is eoid cun herc no refer·
enee ιο it ut ull, ond could ell'ord no instruct-ion to a llornau. The ohscrvutions on
this subject ere interrupted now and then by irrelevant obscrvutious, end on the whole
there can be little doubt either thot the Ars Poetica was published etter Horace'n
death, out of fragments clumsily put together, or thut he published it himself in this
eareless way from that habituel indolence which presented his ever producing ο com·
pletc work of any length, aud which is seen in the abruptness with which sererul of
