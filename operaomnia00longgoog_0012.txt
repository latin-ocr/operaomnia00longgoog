11111111 (especially in the Odes), iu his choico of readings than in
his conjectures. He was always liable to be misled by want of ear
and 11111111 taste', aa well as by the exceee of a‘prurient sagacity
andan unbounded egotism. 'lhe text in this edition will be found to
differ less from Orelli’s than from any other. Where it does so the
reason is, I think, always given in the notes. He collated some
excellent MSS, especially three iu the library at Berua, of which
the oldest he places at the end of the eighth century or the be-
ginning of the ninth, and the other two in the tenth. His other
MSS. were ono of St. Gallen nearly complete, and another ot
Ziirich containing the Odes‚ Epodes, and Ars Poetica, both ot
which he says are of the tenth century. Other MSS. referred to
in these notes are the Vatican and other Roman MSS. collated by
Fea (1811) ; twenty-three MSS. in the Royal Library at Paris
oollated by Pottier (1823), varying in age from the tenth to the
thirteenth century ; and sundry others quoted with or without
name by Lambinus (1577⁸), Cruquius (1611 ¹), Torrentius (1608 ⁸),
and Bentley (1711). Of the laet the most important are four
collated by Cruquiue, and known aa the Blandinian MSS. belonging
11 the monks of a Benedictine monastery in Plaudere, and which
were very soon afterwards destroyed with the monastery by lire.
l'he oldest of these, which is appealed to as a great authority, but
which was certainly more often wrong than right in the instancee
in which Cruquius quotes it, was said to be earlier than the ninth
century. On the margin of this MS. Cruquius found some old
notes, which, aa he says, with infinite paine he deoiphered, and he
has added them to his own commentary in a separate form. 'l'hese
scholia are referred to under the abbreviated title of Comm. Cruq.
They are chiefly made up of the commentarios of Acron and Por-
phyrion, with some additions apparently from other old authori-

ties. The readings of these three Scholiasta help out the MSS,
