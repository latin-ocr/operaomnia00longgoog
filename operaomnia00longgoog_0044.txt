'l'bis 01101110 probably written 011 the return of Caesar Octavianus [named Anguem
00. 27] 10 Rome, atter the taking 01 Alexandria, when the civil wara were ended, and
tbs temple of J anus was shut, nme. 725. Horace expresses the opinion which 'lucitus
(Anu. i. 9) states was held by reticeting men 01 all parties, “non eliud discordantis
patriae remedium fuisse quam nt eb uno regeretur‚” that the only remedy left for the
troubles of the state was an absolute government in the ha'nds 01 0110 person. He baa
beerr charged nith deserting his republican principles, and eren urging the destruction
of those whose party he had once belonged to, and with whom he had fought at Philippi.
Bnt Horace urges reform, not bloodshed; and he had lived long enoughto seethat reform
1100 not to be expected et the hands 01 republican leaders, or from any bnt him whose
geuim was now in the ascendant. 11 10 1101 therefore iu any mean spirit that he urges
Octavianus to take upon himself the tasls of redneing to order the elementa 01 the
atate which so many years 01 01111 war bad thrown into confusion—Nona 01 Ηο1000’0
odes are more justly celebrated than this 101· the imagery it contnins, forits genuine
feeling, and for the delicucy with which it flattcrs Octavianus, investing hirn with divine
attributes, bnt inviting him 10 exereise them ns a father correcting and defending his
children, and thus to avenge in the noblest manner his great-uncla’s murder. ’1110
way in which he introduces the name 01 Caesar unexpectedly at the end bas always
appeared to me an instance 01 consummate art.

The prodigies described at the beginning of this ode are those which were said to have
followed the death 01 C. Julius Caesar. 'l'hey are related also by virgil, Georg. i. 466-
489, which passage, and the verses that follow it to tha end 01 the book, should baread in
connexion with thieode. It will appear to any render 01 both very probablc that Horace
had this description in his mind when he wrote. lt bas been thought that Horace could
not bave referred to prodigies which had occurred so long before (nuo. 710, fifteen years
before this ode was written), when he was et Athens, and therefore oonld not have
witnessed them. Other prodigies therefore have been 0001111101 as the subject ofthese
opening stauzas. But the only other occasions, about this time, when the Tiberis
recorded to have overdowed its beaks, were nnc. 727 and 732, the earliest of which
years would be too late 101· this ode, 111 which the allusione to the state of Rome and
the triumphs of Augustus (1. 49), and the proposai that he should assume supreme
authority, would in tbat ease have been out 01 date and unnecessary, One of the
chief purposes 0101000011 by Augustus was the aveuging 011110 adoptive father’s death;

tuerique acte! Tacitus also speaks 01 him (Anu. i. 9) aa “pietate erga parentem-
ad uma civilia actum ;'' which his enemies turned against him, saying, “Cassii et
Brutorum exitus paternis inimicitiis datos, quanquam fassit privato odia in publicis
utilitatibus remittere.” According to Dion Cassius (11114) his declared purpose was
dnos τῷ τε carpi serres σφαγίντι τιμωρῆσαι arci τὴν πόλιν der μογάλων καὶ ἐπαλλήλων
suar ἐξελέσθαι. Ο11(1(1’011.1.573, sqq.) introduces him as utteriug this prayer
