EPISTLE VH.

>n some occasion Horace having gone into the country for change of air cn account
his health, at the beginning of August, was tempted ιο stay away the whole month;
l as he had promised Maecenas tc return in s few days, he had perhaps received a
ter from his friend reminding him of that promise, and begging him to come back.
scenas was a valetudines-iau, aud had probably some of the querulosa sellishness
rt usually attende on that condition. We may infer as much from that cde (ii. 17),
ich begins “ Car rna querella exanimas tuis ?” and ιο very likely felt the want ot'
rnre's society at this time. We can only guther the tone of his letter or message
m the character cf Horace's reply. He says ιο has uo mind tc risk a return of his
rness by going baelr during the autumn to Rome; indeed that he meant ιο ιο
ent at some warm place on the coast through the winter; that he was no longer
young and cheerful ss ιο had been; that ιο was sure Maecenas’ liberality was
tcwed upon him in a generem spirit, and that he did not mean tc compromise his
spendence; for if he could suppose such was the case, ιο would give up every
ug he had ever received rather than forfeit his liberty. Ηο illustratas his position
two stenen-cue that of the fex who got inte a sessel of corn and grew sc sat
re that he could net get out again (which Horace was determined tc prove was not
case), and the other a splenetie triclr played by 1.. Philippus upon a werthy man
om ιο reduced inte leaving his home end vocaticn aud settling on a farm in the
rntry, the result of which unnatural change was the total destruction cf his peace
l independence. To this too Horace means tc say ιο will never let himself be
mght.

l'here is nothing disrsspectful or angry in the Epistlc, though it might appear from
are outline lilra the above, or from a superficiei reading, that there was. lt was
itten after many years cf intimacy, and shows pretty clearly the influence Horace
laequired with his patrem for though Horace was not perhaps of s servile dis·
ition, as servility was then reclrcncd, he would not have assumed this tone if he
l not been sure Maecenas would not take cffence at it.

l'lrere isno evidence to prove when this llpirtle was written. It is generally attri-
οι ι) the same year as hipp. 15, when Horace was meditating a winter resideres on
ι coast. But the date of that Epistle is also quite uncertain, and Horace in all pro·
rility passed most of his wintere elsewhere than at Rome.
