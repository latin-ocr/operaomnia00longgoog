EPISTOLARUM I. 6.

Νιι admirari prope res est una, Numici3

Solaque quae possit facere et servare beatum.

Hunc solem et stellas et decedentia certis

Tempora momentis sunt qui formidine nulla

imbuti spectent: quid censes munera terrae,

Quid maris extremos Arabas ditantis et Indos,

Ludicra qnid, plausus et amici dona Quiritis,

Quo spectanda modo, quo sensu credis et ore?

Qui timet his adversa fere miratur eodem

Quo cupiens pacto 3 pavor est utrobique molestus3 ιο
Improvisa simul species exterret utrumque.

Gaudeat an doleat, cupiat metuatne‚ quid ad rem,

Si quidquid vidit melius pejnsve sna spe,

Dcfixis oculis animoque et corpore torpet?

Insani sapiens nemen ferat, aequus iniqui, 15
