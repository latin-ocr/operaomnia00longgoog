Kotwithstnnding Agrippe's close connexion with Angustus, it is very probshle that
between that stern mon ond Horace there vves but little sympathy or intercourse, end
without perseunl affection his muse did not rise to its highest flights in the wey olper-
sensl eulogy. Anu during the time thot he wns writing the odes which compose the
three dne books, judging hy their chorncter we moy believe thet he renlly felt unequul
or indisposed for singing the praises of o military here, end thet he considered such sub·
jeets unsnited tobim. 'l'wice he cheolrs himself when he gets upon heroic themes (C.
ii. l. ³73 iii. 8. 69), but not till he hes shown how competent he wns, md he plcnsod‚ te

pers, snd wrote that noble ede in pruisc ef Drusus (w. 4).
