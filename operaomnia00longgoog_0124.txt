Hence, meaning ιο write an ode on the moderate desire and ase ol werith, dedicated
it ιο 0. Sallustius Crispus, grand-cephen ot the hiatorian and inberitor os his property.
Ha had previously alludcd ιο him in no terma ol praiae in Sat i. 2. 48; but that Satira
w written many years before thia ode, aud at this time Sallustius was in high favour
with Augustus and posseased οἱ great ricbes, of which Horace implica that he made a
good uae. From the reference to Phraatea' return to hia throne (v. 17), which took
placa amc. ’124 (we 0. i. 26, Introduction), thc ode must have been written aster that

. event. Proculeius mentioued in v.5was brother or cousin (itisnot certain which)to

laenius Harena, who auno. 7³2 was dctectcd in a conspiracy with one Fannius Caepio
to take away the lia of Augustus (aee C. ii. 10, Introduction). I cannot infer so posi·
tirdy aa liranlre aad othere do that Horace would bave abstained from mentioning the
guercaity ot' Proculam, if hia relation’a crime had becn committed when he wrote ; but
uas chronologirt takes thia allusion as an argument that the ode was written between
