EPISTOLARUM Ι. ll. 603

EPISTLE XI.

Epistlo is addressed ιο one Bodatius, ol whom we know nothing. He was
ng in the Aegean aud in Asia Minor, aud was absent longer than Heraea
or thought good for him ς aud the object oi this latter is to induce him
ru. The commentatore generally have a very mean opinion of Bullatius,
as suffered at their hands harder measure than any oi Horaos's friends.
s chief viee seems to have been a fondness for travelling, and an aspeeial
tion oi some oi the lineat and most ancient towns in the world. Ii we are
to this that ior some raason or other ha was unhappy, and expected ιο
himself hy change of saeue, he may have been mistolsen iu his means, but
›lenty of psople have shared iu his mistake, and when Heraea puta before
us as the end of life the enjoyment oi the present moment-a doctrine ha
to have held pretty strongly-we may doubt whether his philosophy is not
tas bad as his iriend's practico. But wa need not assume any thing iujurious
atina Such reflectione upon travel as oceur in this Epistle might naturally
iggeated themselves whomaosver it had heau written to. We must not judge
's Epistles aa we would private letters, meant only ior the reading oi the
ι they are written to.
rave no means of kuowing when the Epistle was written.

ARGUMENT.

think you, Bullatins, of the fiue places of the Enati are they not all tame
sared without Campus and'l'iber? Have you set your heart upon oue of
lns' towns, or are you ao tired oi travelling that you must settle down at
dus, the duhest of places, aa you know? And yet I oould live there will·
’, 1 oonfass, iorgetting home and every body, to loolr out npou the stormy sea.
tha traveller who turns ia to his tavern to rest would not stay there for even
he who warms himself by the lire or a hot bath does not melre these the aud
is lile. So il yon have been tempest-tost, and have been glad to put into port,
at any reason why you should soll your ship aud never oome baelil These
aare very well for aiolr people‚ but as longas health aud fortune let you beat
e, stay hero aad praise Samos and the rest at a distance. Be thankful ior the
inge οι· the day, aud live for the present hour; so will you be happy whatever
r you may be in. ’Tis reason that takes away sorrow, aud we only change our
awhen we shilh our place. It is but a busy idlenesa that employs us when we
happiness in ships and in eoaches. All you want is hara or at dull Ulubrae, ii
heart ba true aud fail you not.
