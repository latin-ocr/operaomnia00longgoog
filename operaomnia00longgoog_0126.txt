Moron ex Metello consule civicum
Bellique causas et vitia et modos
Ludumque Fortunae gravesque ·
Principum amicitias et arma
Nondum expiatis uncta cruoribus,
Periculosae plenum opus aleae,
lhactas et incedis per ignes
Suppositos cineri doloso.
Paullum severae Musa tragoediae
Desit theatris: mox ubi publicas ιο
Res ordinaris grande munus
