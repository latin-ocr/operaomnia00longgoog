Levabit cultu, virtute carentia tollet,

Ludentis speciem dabit et torquebitur, ut qui
Nunc Satyrum, nunc agrestem Cyclopa movetur.
Praetulerim scriptor delirus inersque videri,
Dum mea delectent mala me vel denique fallant,
Quam sapere et ringi. Fuit haud ignobilis Argis,
Qui se credebat miros audire tragoedos,

In vacuo laetus sessor plausorque theatro;
Caetera qui vitae servaret munia recto

More, bonus sane vicinus, amabilis hospes,
Cumis in uxorem, posset qui ignoscere servis

Et signo laeso non insanire lagenae,

Posset qui rupem et puteum vitare patentem.
Hic ubi cognatorum opibus curisque refectus
Expulit elleboro morbum bilemque meraco

Et redit ad sese: “Pol me occidistis, amici,
Non servastis,'' ait, “ cui sic extorta voluptas

Et demptus pervim mentis gratissimus error.”
Nimirum sapere est abjectis utile nugis,
Et tempestivum pueris concedere ludum ;
