MS. for ‘ vetat,' but if this is so, the preponderance ef the evidence
101 ‘vetet' ought net absolutely to decide in this passage. 'lhere
arc two objections to ‘vetatr' one is the ferm ‘Teque' by which
this lineis connected with the preceding, which contains ‘ vivas;'
and the etheris the difficulty ef being certain about the meaning 01
‘ laevus,' which, as seme critice suppose, significa ‘infaustus' a
meaning which is consistent either with ‘vetet’ 01 ‘ vetat! If
‘ laevus’ significa ‘auspiciousj then we have with ‘vetat’ this
meaning, ‘And thee neither the auspicieus woodpeclrer nor the
wandering erow forbids to ge,’ which is plainly not sense. I am 1101
sure about the meaning 01 ‘vaga,’ but I think it has aninauspicious
meaning. The passage isenricus, and it might be discussed before
a jury of competent men under the guidance 01 1 jndge, who would
prevent the advocates from quarrelling and abnsing ene another, aa
critics do sometimes.

Mr. Macleane observes that he has not accepted a single con-
jecture made by Bentley. These conjectures, it is said, amount to
several hundreda. As far 11 Ι know, very few of Bentley's eon-
jectnres are now accepted by any editor ; 11111 this is a strong con-
damnationes 1 man’s judgment whose great learning is 101111011-
ledged. It seems as if Bentley made many ef his conjectures first,
and then tried to find out reasons fer them. These who know him
only by his criticisms on Milton and his controversial writings,
such 11 the B0yle Lecture and Phileleutherus Lipsiensis, may be
curicus tolcam how he has handled a Iratin poet in whom propriety
01 expression and good teste are conspicuous. If Bentley's Latin
notes were translated into English, men who are not scholars, but
have plain good sense, would find something 01 thesame kind that
they might have seen before in his English writings. It is true
that the notes on Horace did not allow him quite 10 geoden oppor-
tunity of venting his course wit and bad teste as his attach on the
Discourse on Frce·thinking by Antony Cellius, the friend 01 John
Locke3 buthe has dene enough in his Horace te show his great
defects, and young men should be warned against being deluded by

perverse ingenuity. Bentlcy’s powers of assertion were strong: his
