SATIRARUM I. 3. 347

nannet let him bc noturul and msuly; the pessinunte, high spirited 3-this is the
way to make friends and to lreep them. But we do just the reverse, turning virtues
into deseces Αιι honest man is s drivcller3 the slow and sure is ahog ς 11ιι prudent
ond cautious, s liar and a fox; the uusophisticeted, ιι fool.

Whm rashncss thus to establish ιι rule which must resct upon ourselves. sn have ψ

their fsults; he is bost who has fewest. het my friend weigh my good with my bad,
sud l will do the same by him. 11 1ιι would not heve his great deformitics offend
my eye, let him leem to overloolr my little oues: who would heve indulgence must
show it.

ln short, since the defectu of fools, according to your Stoie theory, cannot be got rid of,
it is reasonable we should judge others as we judge ourselves, and visit each fault with
no more thau its due censure. Theman who should crucify his slave for eating the
rennnts of his dnh must be msd; buthe is uot less mad who for some tridiug seule
hstes his friend. Because u friend breuius my old-fachioned dish, οι· helps himself
befom me at table, am 1 to love him the lese for theti tht if he were to commit
thess, or embearlement, or fraud? They who dcclsre that sil faults ιιι elika, ere
refutedby common sensa, experiente, and expediency. Expediencyis the parent of '
justicez therefore men when they were in their first rude state fought like benste for
their food; but when they become eivilized, expediency taught them to make lsws,
which evoey one must admit were hamed to put down injustice. Nature osnuot drew
tue distinction between right and wroug; nor will eny argument convince ιιι11ιι1ιι
petty thett is ss bsd as sacrilege. het us visit ench fault then with its proper mccd
of punishmat3 tinet is, let us not usc the scourge where the whip is only due ς for I
hsre ιο fear of your revusing this and substituting the whip for the seourge, though
you do ssy you would cut up ull vices aliie if meu would but make yon king.

Dou’t you know what our founder Chrysippus ssid 1 ‘⁴ Tho wisc man never made him·
sslf s shoe in his life, yet is the wise man s cobhlcr.” How is this? Why just as
Enogenes is the best cf singers, ewen when his lips are ο1ιιιιι1, und Alfenius con·

eraso thewise mun is the hest aud only worlrman‚ and a king. And yet thou lring of

while your kingship goes down to a chesp bath with uo body-guard but Crispinus
