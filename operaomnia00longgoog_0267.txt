CARMEN VI.

nne. 737.

The appointmsnt oi Hos-eos to compone the prinoipsl ods st the Seonlar Gnmes
mc. 737 seems to heve given him much pleasnre, and to have given his minda new
stimulus in favour oi ode-writing. To the honour thus conferred upon him we owe,
perhaps as much as to Augustus' hidding, this fourth bools, of which tho third, sinth,
sighth, snd ninth all bear mnrlss oi the legitimate pride thet circumstance awakenod.
This sixth ode is a kind of pressos to the Seoulnr Ode, and dwells chiefly on the praisee
oi Apollo ss having been the slayer of Achilles, and thereby having preserved Aeneas
to he the founder of the Roman family: end having prayed for and obtained the help
oi that god for the tnsk he is going to perform, Horace turns, as ohorsgns, to the
membsnofhisohorus, sud instruots theminthsir duty. '
