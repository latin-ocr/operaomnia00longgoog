EPISTOLARUM 1. l.

occurri, rides ; si forte subucula pexae

Trita subest tunicae vel si toga dissidet impar,
Rides: qnid, mea cum pugnat sententia secum,
Quod petiit spernit, repetit quod nuper omisit,
Aestuat et vitae disconvenit ordine toto,

Diruit, aedificat, mutat quadrata rotundis?
Insanire putas sollemnia me neque rides,

Nec modici credis neo curatoris egere

A praetore dati, rerum tutela mearum

Cum sis et prave sectum stomacheris ob unguem
De te pendentis, te respicientis amici.
