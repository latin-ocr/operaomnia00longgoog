EPISTLE Ι.

Assone other sacedotes connected with Augustus, Suetonius, in his 111001 Horace, says,
‘⁴ Post Sermones quoque lectos, nullam sui mentionem habitam ita est questus: ‘Irasci
me tihi seito, quod non in plerisque ejusmodi scriptis mecum potissimum loquaris. An
amoris ne apud posteros tibi infame sit, quod videaris familiaris nohis ease i' Expres-
sitqne elogium, euJus initium est, ‘Cum tot sustineas,' ”dc Porphyrion, upon hipp.
'a ²0, init.. has this note r ‘⁸ Ex his uersibus et in principio sequentis libri apparet
Horatius hoc volumen quasi novissimum totius operis habuisse. Nam secuudum episto·
larum coarctus adjecit ;'’ and at the beginning of this Epistle he says: “Apparet huno
librum, utsupra diximus, hortatu Caesaris scriptum esse: cujus rei etiam Suetonius
unctm est.'' This Scholiast’s authority therefore was probably no other than that
which wa possess in the above memoir, which as early at least us his day was attributed
to Suetonius. But there is uo improbability in the story. A similar theory has been
adrancad in respect to the sixth Ode 01 the first hook, addressed to Agrippa, which,
like thia Epistle, deprecatos the taslr 01 attempting the pmises ot'a gram man. Assu-
ming the truth 01 Suetoniua’ statement, we mast placo the date 01 this Spistle aster
tha publication 01 the first book. lt is generally supposed, with some probability, that
the Seeular Ode aras in Horace’s mind when he wrote v. 1³2 sq. 11 so, the Epistle
was not written till alterave. 737. Beyond this there are no saie data for tlxiug the
time 01 composition. [Ritter concludes that this lipistle was begua at the end 01
auo. 742, and sent to Augustus about the end of 743. 'I'he foundation of his argu·
ment is v. 16, ‘jurandasque tuum per numen,’ aa he reads that line; and he lines the
date 01 the altar 01 Augustus st Lugdunum in anu. 742 or ac. 12. Suetonius
(Claud. 2) says that the altar was dedicated on the flrst 01 August a.o.10,onthe
birth-day 01 Claudius, who was born at Lugdunum. Dion cassim (54. 0. 32) speaks
01 the festival at the altar 01 Lugdunum as existing in ao. 12, and he does not speak
01 the altar being then dedicated. We should rather interirem him that it was dedi·
catcd before ac. 12. Livy’s Epitome 137 places the dedication atter the disturbanoe
in Gallia ou acconem 01 the census, aud this appears to he in no. 12. Clinton suggests
that Suetonius means the anniversary 01 the dedication 5 hut that is certainly not the
meaning 01 his words]

Horace begins hy exeusing himself tor not having written belona (snppoaing the
truth 01 the above story) hy the great labeum and anxioties 01 angustus, on whose
attention it was not for him to intrude. He goes on to commend the discrimination
ol the people, who, contrary to that usual practice by which great men are loaded with
aarynnd abusa when alive and with honours only atter they ars amaneu 1801ῖῦὶωῦ
