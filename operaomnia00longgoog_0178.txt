CARMINUM Ill. 3. 143

Augustus, and the spoech isuot destitute of such oratoaical power as tho case admitted
of. lt also oontrdm indirect exhortations ιο abstinence aud contentment, und so bears
ou the general soope of these odes. Suetonius, in hia life of C. Julius Caeam (c. 79),
says it was generally reported ha meant ιο transfer the seat of empire to Alexandria
(an Troas probably, not the Egyptian city) or to Ilium. Lucan ascribes to him the
same intention, and malros him say (ix. 997),

“Restituam populos: grata vioe moenia reddent
Ausonidae Phrygibus, Romanaque Pergama surgent.’'

Wbether such was really the case or not, it appears that at the time aucha transfer was
not considered too absurd to bs spulren of. We know that the abandouiuent οι· ιιο
mother city for Veii had its advocates, who were not intlueuced solely by the superior
sttnctions of the city, but by dislilre ιο ιιο institutione of Rome and to lawa which could
only ιο got rid of hy such a change. We can easily believe that in Horaoe's time among
the mmalies proposed for the evils of the stato some may hura freely spolreu of trans·
ferriug the sest of goverument to another spot, aud that the site of Troy, tho city of
their supposed ancestors and the fouutain of their racc, may have been fixed upon for
that purpose To meet the spirit of avarica iu soma, und restlessuess in all that would
be mixed up with such a notion, seems to hare been Horace's purpose. One of Orelli's
BernehlSS. has this inscription, “Ad Musas de Augusto quiin proposito videtur
pmseserare? as if Augustus had entertained a desire aud intention like the above, and
ms commentators bave taken up that notion. If it had been the case, thereis no
likelihood that Horace would have taken this occasion and means oi dissuading him.
lbeliere, as 1 said before, ιο wrote these odes, if not by the emperor’s desire,to second
tis efforts, and with his approval.
