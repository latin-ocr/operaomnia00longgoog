Onnum, Scaeva, sutis per te tibi consulis, et seis
Quo tandem paeto deceat majoribus uti,

Disce doeendus adhue quae censet amiculus, ut si
Cneens iter monstrare velit ; tamen adspice si quid
Et nos quod eures proprium fecisse loquamur.

Si te grate quies et primam somnus in horum
Delectat, site pulvis strepitusque rotarum,
