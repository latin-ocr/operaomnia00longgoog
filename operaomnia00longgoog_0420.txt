ln addition ιο the obloquy brought upon him by his satiras, Horace, aiter his intimacy
with Maecenas was known, had to meet the euvy such good fortune was sure to excite
nn birth would furnish a handle for the nuvious, and he was probably called an upstart
and hard naansa oi that sort. ln this satire, which is nothing hut an epistle to
Maecenas, he sparus the idea oi bis birth being any objection ιο him, while at the
nme timo he argues seusihly against men trying to get beyond their own legitimam
sphera, and aiming at honours which are only attendsd with inconvenienee, futiguc,
and ill will. Thia entire, besides the good sense and good feeling it contains, is vulusble
as bearing upon Horace's life. His introduction to Maecenas is told concisely, but
fully and with much propriety and modesty; und nothing can be more pleasing thau
the dlial affection and gratitudo shown iu those parts that relate to bis father and the
adnation be gave him. Ηο takes pleasure iu referring whatever merita he might bave
1ο this good parent, as he did in thc fourth Satira.

‘l'be Satira theu may he supposed ιο have been written chiefly for the purpose of dis·
arming euvy, by showing the modesty oi the author’s pratensions, und the circum
uncas that led to lais intimacy with Macrones. The views ol publio life which it
contains were no doubt sincere, aad the daily rontiue described at tho end was better
nitoal to Horace’s habit oi mind than the sntigucs und anxioties of office. There is
not the least appearance in any ol' his weitings of his having been spoilt by his good
mne and by his intercourse, on terma of rare familiarity, with Augustus, Maecenas,
and ornem and probably malignity never attached any one less deserving of attach
11η Honos. There is no great vigour or variety in this pisce, and its chief vulne is
mut Attempte have been made to fix a date lor the mirrposition, but when
rmus says that became Horace declares he might ride ιο Tarentum is he lihed on a
mule, without attractiug any notice, therefore he must lately have been at Tarentum,
aad must have written this Satira shortly atter the auh, and makes his calculatione
tarn chiefly on this point, it may be inferred thet there ara no sufficient data for
brning any thing like a definite opinion on the subject.

ARGUMENT.

noega tb'e blood oi hings llows in your vcins, Maecenas, you despise not the humbly
born, anch as myself a frecdrnan’s son. lt matters nothing to yon when man’s
fitherwas, il he be but a freeman born, knowing well that King Tullus, ay and
my before him, though they hed uo ancestors, were honest men; while laevinus,
'lame foreiatbers expelled the Tarquins, is not worth an aa, even in the judgment ot

a populace that stupidly worships aneestry. And we who ars so far above them,

bow shall wc judgc? Allow that they prefer a Laevinus with his ancmtors toa
Decius who bad none, aud that the censor might degrade one who should aapire ιο

the senato without being free bom, that need not altor our judgmcnt. 'lhc censor
would act right if he did so ; let every man keep his own place. But high and low

are all willing captives following in the train of glory. erat have you ιο do, Tillius,

ιο munte your tribuneship and your bedge? You nra only drawing more euvy on

your head. The moment a mnu puts on a senator's dress, ‘⁴ Who is this ?'’ says oue.
