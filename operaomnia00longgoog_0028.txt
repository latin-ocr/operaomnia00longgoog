INTRODUCTION. xxiii

more genuine in Horace's writings than his expressions 01 affection 100
his father and 100 Maecenas. His gratitudo 10 Maecenas never takes
the formos servility, his affection naver savours 01 affectation, aad his
familiarity never approaches 10 impertinente. He sees in Maecenas'
gists to himself only the genereus disposition 01 110 giver, 01 which he
has no thought 01 taking undue advantage; his patronage he neither
exaggeratas nor undervalues; 100 110 health he 10010 tenderly; his
danger he tries 10 0100ος and his anxieties he does his best to soothe.
Itis evident that Maecenas valued his society and understood his
character.

At his house, probably, Horace became intimate with Pollio and the
many persons 01 consideration whose friendship he appears 10 have
enjoyed. Throngh Maecenas also itis probable Horace was introduced
10 Augustus, bnt when that happened is uncertain. In amc. 717
Maecenas was deputed by Augustus to meet M. Antonius at Brundi-
sium, and he took Horace with him on that jonrney, 01 which an amusing
account isgiven in the 11111 Satira 01 110 first book. Horace appears
to have parted from the rest 01 110 company at Brundisium, and per·
haps returned 10 Rome by Tarentum and Venusia. (See S. 1. 5, 101).
Between this jonrney aad amc. 722 Horace received from his friend
the present 01 0 small estate 10 110 valley 01 110 Digentia (Licenza),
situated about thirty-four miles from Rome, and 10001000 from Tibur, in
the Sabine country. 01 this property he gives 0 description 10 110 Epistle
10 Quintius ( i. 16), and he appears to have lived there a part 01 every year,
and 10 hare been fond 01110 place, which was very quiet and retired, being
1000 miles from the nearest town, Varia (Vico Varo), the 000100 01 110
district, but 01 00 great importance. During this interval he 000-
tinued to write Satires and Epodes, 101 also, it appears to me probable,
some 01 110 Odes, which some years later he published‚ and others which
he did not publish. These compositione I have 00 doubt were seen by
his friends, and were pretty well known before any 01 them were collected
100 publication. It will appear from the separate Introductions to the
several Satires 01 110 first 1001 1101 11000 10 001000 which might not
have been written by the year A.u.c. 719, aad in that year Franks
supposes the first bools was published. It may have been so, but
Franke's arguments are not conclusive. In auc. 723 the 101110 01
Actium was fought, and 10 110 prospect 01 Maecenas having a command
00 1101 occasion, Horace wrote him a touching poem, which stands first
in the book 01 Epodes. Τ10 01011 Epodc was written immediately

alterationem, and there is 00 mem 10 1101001 01 Epodes which
need be phaed later. Iagree therefore with Franks in thinking that
1001, 01 which one or two poems arc among Horace's earliest composi·
11000, may have been published in 0110724. In that year was written,
