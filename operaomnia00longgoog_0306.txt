EPODON LIBER, 2.

CARMHN II.

Horace, meaning te write on tbe prnises oi tbe country, put bls poem (whether ιι
ι atter-thought or not may be open te conjecture) intothe shepe ot’ a rhapsody by ι
oneygotting usurer who, aster reciting the blessiugs oi a country life sud sighing for
ιο enjoymeut of them, resolring to throw up his business aud persuading himself that
ι dairas nothing ro much as retirement and a humblo lile, finds babit too strong ior
ιιι and fulls back upon the sordid pursuits which atter all ere most congenisl to him.
rme may perhaps think that this little hit oi satire is the chief object ¹ior which the
ιιιιι rm written. Hy impresslon is that it was commenced (whether in imitation ot*
irgil Georg. ii. 45⁸ sqq, ss hhunke supposes, οι· of a poem oi Archilochus [Hs. 21.
αεὶ] ιι lachmann, or not in imitation ot any thing, which is more probable) ιι ι
lsudstio ritae rustieee” (which is the tenor oi most of the inscriptions), and that the
st four versu, thoh have been called clumsy, were added to give the rest s moral.

greith tho supposed speaker. We should not expect, ior instance, to lrear ιι city
rurer talk about su hereditary farm, the dsugers os the soldier aud tbe ssilor, and the
uuo! lore. 'l'be last didioultyis got rid of by Doeriug sud othon, who interpret

u 1 think we must allow tbat Horace was more intent upon bis description then on
rintainiug sn aoeurute consistency between the circumstances of the speaker aud
sentimenta he utters. But, however this may be, the picture ιι very beautiful and
moni very true. ln the most sordid minds more genial impulses will sometimes
e: buttbe beauties of nature aud the ehurms oi a peaceful retirement are, like
scitscit, only attractire ιιι the distance aud at intervals to minds that hare grown
etse to the parauit of gain for rte own salse. To such miuds domestic aud innocent
ura offer no lastiug gratificatiou‚ aud the picture oi rustic enjoyment on the oue
,and oi the jaded but still graspiug usurer struggliug for a moment against his
nsitiss on the other, ufforde a wholesome iesson for many. In respectto the date,
only be conjectured thet Horace had tested the enjoyments he describes ιο gra·
ly, sud was in possession of his serm. But even that is uncmtain. Franks,
ug that Horace must have had before him Vugil’s second Georgic (458 squ),
ιοιιιο say was not published till suc. 724, attributes this ode to 724 also, in
'ris friend Lachmann informs him he seems ‘⁴ nimis subtiliter ignorabilia rimatus
'l'here is s fragment from the eomedy Νῆσοι attributed to Aristophanes (³41⁵
which is very like this ode. Wbether Horace ever saw it ortbought ot it when
rriting. it is impossible to say. It runs thus :-

ὅμῦρε μῶρε, ταῦτα πάντ’ ἐν τῇδ’ ἔνι·
οἰκεῖν μὶν δν ἀγρῷ τοῦτον ἐν rai γηδίῳ
ἀπαλλαγέντα των κατ’ ἀγορὰν πραγμάτων,
κεκτημένον (ενγόριον οἴκεῖον βοοῖν·

ἔπειτ’ &sotter προβατίων βληχωμένων
τροχός τε φωνὴν sle λεκάνην ὧθονμένηι,
Q ιε χρῆσθαι σιινιδίοιι τε καὶ κίχλαις,
