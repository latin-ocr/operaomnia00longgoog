CARMEN XX.

auc. 730 (t).

In the thirteenth ode of the second book Horace relatea how he was nearly killed by
the falling of a tree. In the screnteenth ode of the same hook he associates thie acci·
dent wit-h the recovery of Maecenas from siehnesa, and his reception with applause in the
theatra. The eighth of the third book was written on the first anniversury ef his acci·
dent, aud therefore the year atter Maecenas' reconem, The dates therefore of both
tbeac events to which the edes that more expresaly belong to them give no clue, may be
dctennined if we can determine that of C. iii. 8. It will bc seen by referring to the
introductien to that ode that there is great difference of opinion upon the subject, and
but amali means ef deeiding it. But upon the date of Maecenas’ rccorery depende the
date of this ode, in which hc is invited te drink some Sabine wine hottled on that oeca-
siou. Now wine ef this sort was not in its prime under four years' keeping(0. i. 9.7 n),
aad aaa not likely to hare been fit te drinlr nuder two years. After, therefore, the
maier bas satisfied himself better than 1 ean eatisfy him of the date of C. ii. 13 and
17, be will put thia not less thau two years later, and he will have got aa approximate

data Franks puto it in amo. 729 er 730.

ARGUMEN'I'

lau sballhara earne poor Sabine. Maecenas, bottled at that time when the cchoea of
rna Vatican rwunded your praise. Yon drink Caecuhen and dannan, but the vines
of Palem ane Formiae arc not for me.
