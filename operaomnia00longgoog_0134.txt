“ld Pompilium Verum scribit gaudens ob ejus in petriam reditum quem commilito-

Bit ibe proscribed follower of Brutus cannot be identified with the weolthy Grosphus,

brihteh yeur those os the republican purty who hed followed Sextus Pompeius were
thored to return, peuce being nunde between Sextus ond the triumvirs, und on omnesty

Decier uelis why then Horace should heve used the words “Quis te redonavit,” &ct
rud though the words must not bo taken too literelly ss u question, und ore more un

pretty sertam thet Horace when he 'wrote was in possession of his country -house, and
hed been iu it some time (vv. 19, 20). But he did not get this house till ulter the first
book ot Sutires¹ wne tinished, thet is not till ωε. 720, and it moy hove been u yeur or

Horace would beve alluded to Philippi in the wey he here does, if he were writing soon
