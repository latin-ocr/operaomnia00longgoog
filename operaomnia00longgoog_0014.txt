PREFACE. ix

Presaee has laid down a scheme determining the dates of the several
⁵ booles, without stating the grounds on which he founds it. It
will be seen that Ι prefer hhanke's opinion on this subject to
Kirchner’s, but that there are many instances in which his aeel
appears to outstrip his judgment in determining the date of

mene poene.

of the other books that Ι have used Ι have been most indebted
to Estre's Prosopographeia Horatiana (Amsterdam, 1846), a most

Ihsve studied with much pleasure the fragments of the Greek

tried to confine myself to such passages as throw light upon the
text, or appear to have been imitated hy or copied from Horace.
When I have met with a quotation in any ol the late commentators
that appeared to have originated from himself,I have given his

quotation is only one of the common stoclr that has accumulated
from the Scholiasts downwards, I have given credit lor it to no one,
but do not on that aqoount wish to have the credit of it myself.
Il any have been suggested by my own memory or reading, I have
