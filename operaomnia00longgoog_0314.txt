EPODON LIBER, 4. 281

GARMEN IV.

All the positive information we esu derim from this ode iu respect to the pnrport and
date is, thet it contains s vehemoht invective against some person of low birth sud eon·
temptible character, wbo gave himself aire, aud diegusted the people of Rome: he was
also a military tribune. 'l'he approximate timeis tired by the laet lines, which show
chat it was written while Caesar Octavianus was preparing or carrying on wer against
Sextus Pompeius, who had enlisted in his service pirates end slures, as we leam from
Dion (49. ο. 1-12. See below, ix. 10). To bring us nearer tothe exactdate, it bes been
argued (first by blason in his llfe of Horace) that, inasmuch as in the second expedition
of Cesar agaiuet Sex. Pompeius tbere were enlisted in his fleat a grest body of slaves, it
is not probeble that Horace would heve used language of contempt which would apply aa
much ιο Caesar’s as the enemy’s force. lt must therefore have been written, if this
mnrnption hasany weigbt, before thatarmament was formed, which was noel 17. ln

with oonfldence this Epode was written. lt is elso stated by ellthe Scholiaats that Menas

torinlclmrecter. The objections raised to Menoe being the person alluded toare: 1. That
lior-nea would not have failed to notice the treachery as well es the pride of this person.
hue that argument, which is Gesner's, bas no great force. Horace meent to attach the
suggeriug aire of the man, which were more offensivo ιο the citizens theu his betrayal
of Pompeius. by which they had gained, and which could not have been noticed without
offending Caesar. 2. 'llrat Menas had been eo short a time iu Rome, that he could not
