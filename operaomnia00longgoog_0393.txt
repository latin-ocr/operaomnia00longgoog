est was the liberty wherewith those worthies of ιιο Old Comedy set their marl upon
ιιο wioious, sud them Lucilius hes copied ; u man of wit end perception, but a hursh
rereitier 3 csring less for ιιο quality of his verses than the quantity ; full of words and
lull of fuulta, which he was too lszy ιο avoid. Aa ιο your quantity, I cure not for
ιιιις und when Crispinus challenges me st great odds ιο try which of us can write
quiekcst, I decline the invitation, und thoul heaven that 1 am aman of quiet tem
ροοιιοοοι and few words. lle may go οο pulling and blowiug like u pair of bellcws,
hut that is not in my way. ’

write (and 1 anu too nerrous ιο reeite it in public), because meu do οοι ιιο ιο heve

pust. cix feet in a verse whieh otherwise is mere prom, this does not mulie a poet,
bus genius, inspiration, and sublime langnuge. And this hes led some ιο question
vuele comedy is poetry, seeing that ιιο lauguage and ideas ere all those of oom-
mr life. 'lhere are your fathers, for instance, scolding their sons, just es you may

ιω.) Βοι this question I may discuss elsewhere. lily present purpose is ιο show that
you hare nc reason ιο ιο afraid of this sort of writing. There arc your informers

But, wau supposing you are ιιο regne, l am οο informer. 1 hare no desire tohave

moy, and do it with malicioua intent.'' How can you charge me with this? lisy,
the man who slanders his friend behind his beclr, or fuils to defend him from the
