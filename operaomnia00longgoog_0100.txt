CARMINUM 1. 28. 63

though most even os those who divide tho colloquy at v. 6 bave overlooked thie diffi-
culty, sud accepted ‘te’ ou the authority of the MSS. But ‘nauta’ is not properly a
common sailor, but ‘nauculariusss a shipmastcr. “ Nautam accipere debemus eum qui
navem exercet: quamvis nautae appellantur omnes qui navis nangandae causo in nava
aunt. Sed de exercitare solummodo Praetor sentit ” (Dig. 4. 9. 1. 5 2). The ‘exercitur’
is the person who churters the ehip. There does not seem to be auy natural division at
v. 16, and for Archytas ιο begin (at v. 21) with ‘Me qnoque deveri,' dcc, nothing
having gone before with which ιο connect those words, ia also unuaturel; while, if we
understand him tobeginhis reply at ‘Sed omnes una manet nox,' wa have an opposition
between the enreasm cf the first speaker (who says ironicully of those that aeyrired to
connexion with the gods and to the highest order of wiadom that they had not escaped
death, not even Pythagoras, though ho pretended to have done so once) and the grave
troth, solernnly propounded by the philosopher, that all must die, wiae aud unwise, old
and young, on land or at sea, and illustrated by his own case This was once my
opinion, and aa many will still adhere to the theory of the dialogus and Archytas' ship-
wreck, 1 bave put that theory in what appears ιο me the best form. The other expla-
nation οἰ the ode, however, 1 feel little doubt, is in the main the true one. Another, ιο
which Orelli inclined (though he suspended his judgmeut on the whole question), sup·
poses a sailor coasting along tlre Apulian shore and seeing the tomb of Archytas, where·
upon he breaks out into the address ‘'l'e maris,' dec, frum v. 1 ιο 20. 'lhen the ghost
os a lately shipwrecked man comes forward and prays for a little saud. lt would be
difficolt to imagine any circumstances that could have suggested such a soene, especially
with so abrupt a change of persons. 'l'he sudden apparition of a ghost echoing back tc
the mariner at aea his own words ιο my mind appears almost ludicrous.

One difficulty appears ιο me to be fatal ιο the uotion οι a dialogue, and that is con·
tained in the second and third verses, in which it appears to bc clearly intimated that
the body of Archytas bas already received that which he is supposed so earnestly to
pray sor: for though many, 1 am aware, get over this difficulty by supposing ⁴ cohihent
munera’ tc mean that the want of tho scanty gift of a little earth was keeping him
haek from his rest, 1 donet see how the words will bear that senae3 nor can ltranslate
‘cohibent' with Dillenbr. aud others, as if it was meant that his body occupied but a
small space on the surface ol the greum. 'l'he words ean only mean that he was under
the rand, whether partially or otherwise, and in either case ha would not require duat
tc be east three times on him.

'l'nis consideration, aa well as the unity aud simplicity it gives to the ode, has induoed
ure, with much conlidence, to adopt tha explanation l have given. The propriety of a
aea-farmg person being appealed to eonsists in his being exposed ιο risk of the same
iate with the person who appeals ιο him.

ARGUMENT.

Eren thee, thou measurer ol eamh and ses, thou counter of the sunm, Archytas, bow
mall a portion of earth contains thee now! It prolits thee not tohave searched the
air aud mversed the heavena since thou wert to die. So Tantalus, Tithonus, and
llinos bave died, aud Pythagoras too with all his learning bath gone down once more
tothe grave. But so it is: all must die ahke, some to make sport for Mars, some
avallowed up in the deep: old and young go crowding to the grave: none cseape: 1
habere perished in the waters. But grudge me not, thou mariner, ahaudful of

ι earth: so may the storm spend itself on the woods while thou art sale and thy mer·
ebaadizeincreases. la it a small matter with thee ιο bring ruin ou thy children?
lea, perhaps retribution aweits thysels: my eurses will be heard, and then uo atone-
neut shall deliver thee. 'Tio but the work ol a moment—thriee eust earth upon rna
nemon.
