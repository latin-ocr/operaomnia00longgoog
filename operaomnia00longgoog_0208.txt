CARMINUM 111. la. 173

Non times detur 3 socerum et scelestas
Folle sorores, 4ο
Quae velut nactae vitulos leaenae
Singulos eheu lacerant: ego illis
Mollior nee te feriam neque intra
Claustra tenebo.
Me pater saevis oneret catenis
Quod viro clemens misero peperci ;.
Me vel extremos Numidarum in agros
Classe releget.
I pedes quo te rapiunt et aurae
Dum favet nox et Venus, i secundo ⁶0

Omine et nostri memorem sepulcro
Scalpe querelam.

brabium says, “haec ode est παραινετική seu προτρεπτική, id est sd suadendum et ex·
ammaum? the meaning of which is not very clear. 'lhe way 1 understand the first
alm and its manerios with the second may be seen from the argument. Some sup·
pun suns Neobule ir contrasting her own condition with that of others. ‘ Miserablc are

de not qmrrel with that interpretation, bnt prefer the other. Thercis a fragment of
Aban· (68 Bergk) that may have belonged to a poem which furnished the materials
of sni· ode. Some hauc msumed it to bea free translation from Alcaeus' poem. There
is nothing more to Judge from than this fragment, which runs thus: ἐμὲ telasa, eni
