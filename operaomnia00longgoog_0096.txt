passage, as it contains with sufficient accuracy most 011110 01001101 Parthian history
which Horace alludes to. The assembling of the Scythian force and the alarm of Tiri·
dates are evidently referred to here, and the two seem to be associated. lt is natural
to infer, therefore, that 111100 just before Tiridates lled from his kingdom, in 0110.
⁹129, tbst the ode was eomposed Some, however, have referred 11 10 the period when
Phraates' ambassadors were iu treaty with Augustus, and when the fate of Tiridates
mnndeeided, which would put the date a year later. Others again have assumed
that the whole of the transactione described by lustin are to be referred to the year
ist, 01111 that Tiridates never 11011 10 Augustus in Spain at all. This is the judgment

sustin bad the history 01 Trogus, which he abridged, and must hare known better
than lachmann what it contained. His reason, moresver, for wishing to place 1110 dato
of the ode further back is nothing more than 011 objection 101110 rhytlrm of the 7111 01111
llth verses, which is a very fallacious argument. ln favour of the earlier date is
quoted, by 0101111118, Georg. ii. 495 :-
“ Illum uon populi fasces non purpura regum
flexit et infidos agitans discordis fratres ;''
where the brethrcn 010 Phraates and Tiridates. The Georgica having been written not
later than 724, it is assumed that 1110 events above referred to must have taken placo
before that year. But the earlier and nnsuceesaful designs of Tiridates are more pro·
bably referred to by Virgil. Agrinat the earlier date thare is an argument 01 much
weight in the age of Lamia. He died 0110. 786 (Tac. Ann. ri. 27), and the year before
he had held the office of praefert of the city. If hc was only twenty when this ode 1100
written. he must have been eighty-two when he died, 01111 eighty-one when hc held 1110
abore post, which was made 0110 01 considerable importance by Augustus, and continued
to be 00 001101 1110 successor. 11010 described as being ‘vivida senectute’ at the close
(1 his life, 01111 it ’10 just possible he may 11010 held the abovc post 01 that advanced age,
ht it is not probabis, and 1 think it 0 1011 argument, as far as it goes, for putting the
lace of the 011000101010 1100011. For further particulare respecting Lamia see iii. 17.
’1110 attempt to deduce 11001 this ode any evidence 01 his being of 0 melancholy tempe-
11010111 is ridiculous.
