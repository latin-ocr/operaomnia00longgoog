INTRODUOTION.

Tur materiale for Horaoe’s life are derived almost entirely from his
own works. Α few additional facts ars got from a short memoir
attributed to Suetonius.

He was born ou the eth December, atto. 689 (ac. 65), at or near
Venusia' (Venena), in the Apennines, on the borders of Lucania aud
Apulia. llis father was a freedman¹, having, ae his name proves, been
the slave of some person of the Horatia gens. As Horace implies that

lue himself was ingeuuus⁸, his father must have obtained his freedom η

before his birth. He afterwards followed the calling of a coactor⁴‚ a
collector of money in some way or other, it is not known in what. He
' made in this capacity enough to purchase an estate, probably a small
one, near Venusia. We hear nothing of his mother, except that Horace
spealrs of both his parents with affection ⁸. His father, probably seeing
signs of talent in him as a child, was not content to have him educated
ata provincial school, but took him (at what age he does not say, but
probably about twelve) to Rome, where he became a pupil of Orbilius
Pupillus⁸, who had a school of much note, attanded by boys of good
family, and whom Horace remembered all his life as an irritable macher,
giren unneoesssrily to the use of the rod. With him he learnt grammar,
the earlier Iatin authors, and Homer. He attended other masters (of
rhetoric, poetry, and music, perhaps) as Roman boys were wout, and
had the advantage (to which he afterwards looked back with gratitudo)
of his father’s care and moral training during this part of his education.
It was usual for young men of birth and ability to be sent to Athens to
finish their education hythe study of Greek literature and philosophy
under native teachers3 and Horace went there too, at what aga is not
known, but probably when he was about twenty. Whether his father
was alive at that time or dead is uncertain. If he went to Athens at
